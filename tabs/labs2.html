      <h3>King 135: The <strong>Social</strong> Lab.</h3>

      <p>
      <strong>Have fun.</strong><br>
      Talk to your friends.<br>
      Argue math at the whiteboard.<br>
      Ask questions of strangers.<br>
      Play games, listen to music.<br>

      <strong>This is still a work space.</strong><br>
      Please ask others in the lab<br>
      before beginning an activity<br>
      that you anticipate as distracting or loud.<br>

      If someone is doing work<br>
      and requires quiet,<br>
      respect their wishes.<br>

      <strong>Games are the lowest priority.</strong><br>
      If you are playing a game<br>
      and someone needs your machine<br>
