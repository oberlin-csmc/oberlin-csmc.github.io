<h1>First Programming Skills Workshop!
</br>
Saturday, November 6 from 4-6pm </h1>

<p>
Remember to bring a pencil and paper as we will be working out a lot of these problems by hand.

<p>
See you there!

<h1>What are the workshops about?</h1> 
<p>
Here's a challenge for all of you: code up a program that will implement quick sort. You can't refer to any resources and you can't ask for any hints. Oh, and do it in five minutes. On paper. But don't make any mistakes!
This is the kind of pressure that most of us will find ourselves in sooner or later. We are most likely to run into situations like this when applying for jobs or applying to grad schools. 
As some of you may or may not know, when you apply to a software engineering position, as an intern or full-time, a standard portion of the interview process will involve answering technical questions. 
Usually you only have a few minutes and you almost always have to write your solution on a whiteboard or piece of paper. The technical questions will almost always involve algorithms that you used to know but are a little rusty on. 
They will involve data structures that you learned in 151 but haven't since touched.  They will probably involve recursion. The same thing applies to those of you who are taking the GRE subject test.

<p>
But never fear! Because these skills are not hard to learn--they just take practice. 
Since we want the Oberlin CS department to do as well as possible on their job interviews/standardized tests, the CSMC has decided to host, for the first time ever, Programming Skills Workshops! 
During these workshops we will tackle a variety of problems, write our solutions on paper, and then discuss the solutions. As a group, we'll learn what challenges we face, what approaches to take, and what solutions work the best. 
Most importantly, however, we will become the best programmers we can be.

So whether you are graduating soon, applying for internships, or just want to hone your programming skills, you should definitely be seriously considering attending these workshops.
