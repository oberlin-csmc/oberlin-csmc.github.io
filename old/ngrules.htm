<LI>    When rebooting a machine, use the proper procedure and do not
hard reboot (i.e. don't just press the reset button).

<LI>    Do not install licensed software onto any of the Computer
Science machines without prior approval of the systems administrator.
To do so otherwise is strictly forbidden.

<LI> 
        You are responsible for anything that happens through your 
        account.  Never leave an X server unattended.  If you must
        leave the lab briefly, use the xlock program to lock your
        console. If you leave the lab for more than 15 minutes, LOG
        OUT. NEVER leave your X server unattended without xlock;
        i.e. DO NOT USE stuff like xmessage.  
<LI> 
        Be aware that accidental spills of drinks and beverages could destroy a 
        machine.  Any food must be kept away from the keyboards and
        you must clean up after yourself.  The lounge area is a much
        better place to eat than the lab.

<LI>    Keep the lab clean and organized.  Throw out scratch paper,
        candy wrappers, etc., put away your books, before you leave! 

<LI>    Be considerate of others.  This is a work area.  Do not play
        music if anyone objects to it.

<LI>    Refrain from any offensive behavior that might interfere with
        other's work.  This includes downloading and/or viewing pornography.

<LI>    Only CS students and those specificly authorized are allowed
        to use the lab.  If you see people in the lab who shouldn't be
        there, politely ask them to move on.

<LI>    Do not turn off any CS equipment except in the case of a dire 
        emergency. Contact an upper-level student if you need help 
        unfreezing a machine. 

<LI>    Game playing has the lowest priority for machine usage.  If 
        you are playing a game and someone else needs your station for 
        work, you must yield to them. Games not involving computers 
        should not be played in the lab.

<font face=arial size=-1>
<UL>

<LI>    Do not play X games on occs. 

<LI>    Long-running jobs should be niced to 19, and the system
        manager should be informed of them. 

<LI>    You may not let anyone else use your account, unless you are 
        directly supervising them. 

<LI>    You may not use the system as a launching platform in order to 
        break into any other system, to steal software, or to perform
        any illegal activity. 

<LI>    Any network service, and anything that might compromise system 
        security. must be cleared by the system manager before being
        started. 

<LI>    You may not run processes on faculty machines without the
        express permission of the faculty member in question. 

<LI>    You may not create a world-writable directory. 

<LI>    Passwords should contain no proper names, at least one number,
        letter, and punctuation symbol. The more esoteric the better.

<LI>    Do not hog system resources unnecessarily. 

<LI>    If something strange happens on any CS equipment, send mail to 
        the system manager describing what happened in
        complete detail so that he can take action.  

<LI>    Please notify the system manager if you no longer need your
        account.  

<LI>    Directory trees should not be nested excessively.  While this 
        is not likely to happen in practice, there has been at least
        one instance of a highly nested frivolous directory tree
        construction causing the automatic reboot process to be
        aborted requiring manual intervention and adversely affecting
        the system's return to working status.
