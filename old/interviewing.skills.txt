*****************************************************************************
I think learning to brag is an American-specific skill.  Males
from other countries (Asia, in particular) also have a similar problem
here, though they have more of a problem getting promoted once they are hired
rather than getting hired in the first place.  I think that is because
the expectation of the interviewer is that they are smart (not true in
general about women).  So, unfortunately, we have to overcome that
negative expectation even more than men by "bragging".

My main worry is that you will be uncomfortable with "bragging"
because that is not your style (& the interviewer will pick up on it).
I hope you get phrases to use for certain types of questions that you
are comfortable with.  Also, before an interview, you need to psych
yourself up with all the positive things about yourself so that you
really are confident about your abilities.  Then, if something unexpected
or intimidating occurs in the interview, you still have confidence in
yourself.  I think feedback from systers will help with that.
(I wish I had had such a resource 15 years ago).

Then, once you get the job or school acceptance, the bragging doesn't stop.
You still have to keep up the image that you are really good & you know
how to figure things out yourself.  Image is especially important in
the beginning.  Another problem women have is to ask questions when they
know 3/4 of the answer (or maybe all of the answer, for some reason).
I guess this relates to underestimating themselves in an interview.
Also, you don't have to reveal the source of your knowledge.  Men seem
to be able to learn things, then act as if they figured everything out
themselves or that they always knew it.  I catch myself explaining when
I find that I know something that someone else doesn't.

Good luck.  
***************************************************************************

There's an EXCELLENT book, if you haven't read it already.  It's called
"Sweaty Palms".  I think the author's name is Medley.  It's relatively
easy to find in a good bookstore.

This book will tell you everything you need to know about interview preparation,
and almost everything you need to know about interviewing.
***************************************************************************

I interview well and it is my ability to talk which allowed me to get jobs
I technically was not qualified for.

Some basics:

	Nerdy types do not like to interview you any more than you want
	to be interviewed by them. Talking, even to the point of mono-
	polizing the 'talk time' is good, but you shouldn't talk just to
	hear your voice. The time should be spent finding out about the
	interviewer, what role he/she plays and 'bragging' about yourself.
	The purpose of finding out what the interviewer does is to help 
	you focus the interview towards your qualifications and how you 
	can solve The Problem.

	Managers, however, also like to talk. Let them. Even if they tell
	a bad joke, laugh. Managers are looking for someone who fits the
	bill technically (that's why he/she has nerds interview prospects)
	and is someone who has a personality fitting with the group dyn-
	amics. Small talk, like hobbies, frequently enter the discussion.
	Good chemistry with the manager is essential; the general rule I
	follow is to be sociable, but not ingratiating, and brag only when
	necessary. Managers know your resume' has some fluff and a good
	manager can usually figure out where it is. This is especially
	true if a headhunter arranged the interview. Another rule is to
	tell the truth on a resume' but tell it in such a way that SOUNDS 
	better than you are.

	The HR person or higher more senior type manager wants to know 
	who you are. Not what you know. What school you went to and do
	you have a family are information they frequently ask. The HR
	person wants to know because he/she has to arrange relocation 
	if the company had to fly you in for the interview. The senior
	manager wants to know because the money for that is coming out
	of his budget. You are not obligated to answer those questions
	since Federal Law technically prohibits it, but if you do have
	a family or spouse and relocation is a problem, you should say
	so. If the same is true, or you have a same sex marriage or
	living arrangement, and relocation is not a problem, say that 
	relocation is not a problem. Be tactful and polite but firm if
	you think the HR person is overstepping the boundaries of what
	you wish to divulge. Small talk helps, but try not to divert
	the conversation to a discussion of the person's children if
	you see pictures of them on the cubicle wall or desk, unless
	the interviewer started it.

	Generally an interview will consist of 1-2 managers, 1 HR per-
	son and 3-4 technical people. The whole process takes about 4
	hours and you might want to consider bring chewing gum to help
	water your throat. It is a *lot* of talking. The second inter-
	view is less gruesome, will not usually involve the HR person
	or the managers. The HR person is the one stuck checking out
	your references. A good thing to put on your resume' is re-
	ferences furnished upon request. That way you could line up
	references which are suitable for the job for which you are ap-
	plying. Graduate students should have not only the advisor,
	but the senior researcher as one of the references.

Some assumptions about this strategy:

	You are a fast learner. No one is a perfect fit for a job; man-
	agers take the path of least resistance and find the best fit.
	Never brag more than you could learn in three months. That is
	usually your trial period. Your friend is right when he said 
	to brag more. Everyone else is doing it; so should you. This 
	takes practice. If you don't brag 'correctly', you will sound
	like an arrogant hothead...and no one wants to work with those
	kind of people. 

	Perhaps you could take a hypothetical technical question or
	ask someone for one, assess your knowlege base for that question
	and formulate an answer. Ask people to write down their imp-
	ression of your knowlege based upon your answer. Then judge 
	their description according to what you wanted to say and the 
	job description. E-mail is not a good forum because E-mail 
	removes the face-to-face social dynamics of interviewing. If
	you were in the SF bay area, I could help you with developing
	interviewing skills. I'm sure others on this list who live 
	or work near you can also help. Ask.

An example of bragging:

	For an UNIX Memory management job and the techie asks you about
	segmented memories. You never worked on a segmented memory system,
	but you know what a segment is. This is for a *86-based computer.
	You know how the hardware works. If you were to just say that the
	*86 has a segment register which you load in the TSS, etc, the
	techie would probably reject your resume' when asked by the man-
	ager for feedback. An alternative is to say that you'd divide
	the address space into four segments, the highest of which would
	be for system tables, so the system's part of the user address
	space would always be there. Then when you made the context switch,
	the system base register would never change values, blah, blah 
	blah. (I don't know if this is a technically good answer since
	its been a while since I last worked on an Intel processor). The
	difference is that the first said nothing new. The second implies
	without saying so, that you've actually done this before and if
	it sounds technically feasible, then the techie is far more like-
	ly to buy your answer. 
	
	You don't necessarily have to actually written a UNIX-like memory 
	manager for a *86, but it is essential that you know something 
	about Intel processors and Unix memory management. The rest is 
	ad-hoc and defines in your own mind what you have to learn. But 
	the techie is convinced that he/she could work with you given 
	your knowlege. Such a tactic could work with a network protocol
	position, or even databases, where there is some ramp-up but
	the difference of knowlege is relatively small. However, for a
	job which involves a language you do not know, perhaps a 4GL for
	a database, then this tactic will fail because you may have to
	explain some code. Its not necessarily buggy code; the techie just
	wants to know if you know the language.

a long time ago i was helped by info on interviewing in the book Who's hiring 
who --- author, ????
**************************************************************************

I agree that it is very important to emphasize your accomplishments
during an interview.  The exercise of writing a good expressive resume
does wonders to remind yourself and your interviewer of true meat of
the accomplishments. It takes a much more talented interviewee to get
out the valuable parts of your experience at the crucial moment if you
haven't already made this crystal clear both in your mind and in the
resume (so they will prompt you for details).  You have to really
distill each piece of experience and think about what you got from it,
remind yourself what was required to get there etc.  If you are like
me, it's easy to forget a stressfull application process, or how good
the competition was for a job or grad school, or how difficult a
technical challege was after you succeed at doing what you were aiming
for.  I usually breathe a quick sigh of relief, and look for what's
coming next.  I also think if you put things in the right terms at
your interview you don't have to come out sounding like you are
bragging - which is what most of us are afraid of and what we were
told while growing up was not polite.  I like phrases like - XX was a
great opportunity for me because it gave me the chance to learn Y and
Z and to find out that I had a lot of insight into these types of
problems...  That is - give the facts that support the claim instead
of just the claim.  Then you also have the chance to throw in
something they might not have asked about. Also saying you really
enjoyed something and why often comes out with the same effect as
saying you are really good at it.  Even the other way works -
something like 'I wasn't really looking forward to that project/class
but it turned out to be very valuable because I was the only
experienced technical person involved and I had responsibility for...'
or maybe for classes '... all the other people in my project group
dropped the class and I finished the project on my own...'

I think the confidence aspect is more subtle and comes naturally from
believing that your accomplishments are valuable, deserved and as a
result you are worthy of their attention.  As serious as this sounds,
I don't think you need years of therapy to achieve this.  I think a
good old fashion pep talk goes a long way. I would try to sit down
with a good friend who knows your field and discuss what was
challenging about your past few projects, what you know better than
your collegues - because everyone has their specialties, and what
aspects of your past experiences you want to find in your new job -
just in general to remind yourself of what you do well.  Enthusiasm
about the work you are discussing is at least 80% of confidence.  If
you display excitement about things you learned or work you did you
will naturally discuss some details of the project that will sound
impressive - because that was what made the project interesting,
right? You will also convey the feeling to the interviewer that you
have the energy as well as the experience to tackle new things.

Practice alot too.  Sign up for a lot of interviews, even some you
aren't as thrilled about!

******************************************************************************

When I was interviewing, I used a book called "Knock 'em Dead, Answers
to Tough Interview Questions",   I'm afraid I've forgotten the author and 
I lent the book to a friend so I can't look it up, but I know it is a very
popular book and really goes over how to sell yourself.  I think the same
author has another book called "Hireing the Best" which is all about the
other side of the interview and it can be very helpful to read that one as
well.

***************************************************************************

I was recently given a copy of Computerworld, campus edition,
oct 31 '92, v5 #4. It's titled Computer Careers and contains 
several excellent sections, including 

* a list of questions to ask the interviewer
* suggestions on answering questions
* a couple profiles of senior women
* a salary survey that discusses the gender gap in pay

but check out this quote:

  James Hackett, director of legislative data systems at the Rhode Island 
General Assembly in Providence, says he believes women tend to assume
traditional, lower-level IS roles and lack aggressiveness.

=>  "I'm critical of [women] that work for me that don't demand more"  <=

******************************************************************************

I know this sounds cliched, but PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE!! When I
was interviewing several years ago, a friend and I would go out to
dinner, and we'd pretend that it was a job interview (he'd interviewed a
lot of people). He asked me all his hardest questions, which made the
real interviews a breeze. If you have a friend a few years ahead of you
in your field, offer to buy her/him dinner in exchange for giving you
a really tough interview. Some college campuses also have a career
counseling center with a staff which will do mock interviews. These
are useful for general interviewing skills, but the staff member will
probably not know much about your field, so there's a limit to how
technical the questions will be.

Good luck!

******************************************************************************

I couldn't tell from your address where you are, but if you are in the
Bay Area, I highly recommend the Career Action Center in Palo Alto.
They give seminars on interviewing and other job search and career-related
topics, and they have counselors moderating job search groups where people
looking for work talk about issues that have come up in their interviews,
ways for tracking down jobs leads, or whatever is on their minds.  I 
learned a couple of thousand tricks from the job search groups there!

A good book to read is:  Interviews that Knock'em Dead (or something like
that).  Some people don't like the author's blunt "here's what people want"
attitude, but the advice is very good.

Finally, my favorite interview preparation technique:  Write down the
three questions you are most afraid of being asked at an interview.  (It 
doesn't matter if they are questions that are generally asked, the idea is 
to get at what you're really afraid of when you go to an interview.)  Then 
practice answering those questions in front of a mirror in the most 
confident, professional tone you can maintain.

Good luck with your job search,

*******************************************************************************

There was one thing I did when I first graduated from college that helped
with my interviewing.  A friend of the family was a head hunter and he
volunteered to give me a practice interview.  I went for the interview
as if it was "the real thing" and he gave me an honest critique.  After
that experience, I have been much more successful at interviews.  Obviously
not everyone has a friend that is a recruiter, but there are enough
recruiters out there who would be willing to give feedback on their
prospects interviewing skills.  I definitely think it helped to get 
feedback from someone actually in the business of getting people jobs.

One point that has always been helpful to me was to keep in mind that
interviewing is a sales pitch.  You're there to convince them that
they want to hire you.  Don't tell them reasons why this job 
would be good for you, tell them reasons why hiring you would
benefit them.  Even if they ask you questions about 
why the job would benefit you, try to turn it around so that you tell
them how hiring you would benefit them.  Once you have the job
offer, worry about whether the job is right for you.

******************************************************************************

Given that you have already acquired a certain amount of
savvy about what your job market is looking for, and how
much you are willing to put out to impress, then you are
your own best teacher.

Borrow or rent a camcorder and have someone interview you
in front of the camcorder.  Then see how you come across,
what you do well, what you want to improve, etc.

If you think you need raw exposure/practice to be comfortable,
film someone asking you interview questions, and then play
those questions back to yourself, with remote in hand, answering
the questions as you go.  If you think you could have done
better, then back up and try again, just as you would if you
were practicing the piano.

There are a lot of training companies making a lot of money
offering experiences like this, but there's no reason you can't
cobble it together yourself.

******************************************************************************

I can't tell from your address where you are located.  In Palo Alto,
there is an excellent resource called the Career Action Center which
runs workshops to help one with interviewingand other skills for the
job search.   If you are anywhere in the San Francisco Bay area, they
are
worth looking into.  If not, perhaps there is something similar where
you are.

I've also found it useful to read books on the job search, as much for
getting into the right frame of mind as for the specific details of
their recommendations.

******************************************************************************

I took a job finding workshop 11 years ago that has provided me with the 
skills of "interviewing well".  The foremost tactics used to create this 
skill was coming up with a list of "likely questions" pertaining to your 
field and then creating a "pat script" for each question.  The idea then 
is to practice, practice, practice interviewing by giving your script to 
any/all friends who will "do the play with you".  Video tape it if 
possible, enhance the script and refine it, have an observer critique you 
and the script for changing to more positive buzz words and effects.  
Eventually a confident answer evolves out of each question that any 
variation of that question can be handled with ease. The key is to 
practice.  I went thru 2 weeks of all day repeated interview sessions 
alone with 20-30 people who took my script reworded each question in a 
way they felt comfortable. (This was after three days of question 
developement for my trade.)

I've change jobs 6 times in the last 11 years and have gotten each one 
for which I interviewed.

Hope this helps,

***************************************************************************

For one thing, you should look upon everything you say from the point
of view of the company.  In resumes, I see the following type
of comment so often: "want job that will be challenging and interesting,
preferably in the NW, and that will permit me to expand my experience in
the area of blah blah blah and have advancement opportunities."

Well, that person has just told the company what the applicant WANTS (in a
fuzzy sort of way).  But so WHAT?  How is the company supposed to interpret
this, and why should they bother?  And what if the company is not located
in the NW; should they ignore the application?  The applicant wants to
get into the field to "expand" their experiences -- perhaps they're not
really qualified for the job?  And who knows if the applicant would find
a particular job to be "challenging and interesting?"

Instead of talking generalities, we have to sell ourselves, our 
abilities, our areas of expertise, our strengths.  We don't need to
tell them about vague career goals.  Specific career goals can be mentioned
during the interview if they are an absolute must to you and you want 
to weed out any company that doesn't fit.  Mostly you want to focus on
your knowledge, experience, abilities, and a willingness to learn and work
hard.

During the interview you should be personable, friendly, alert (don't sit
and look at the floor...), and responsive.  You shouldn't be overly quiet 
and shy, and should speak up (but avoid joking around).  You should have
ideas about what you want to work on and how you want your career to
turn out, but remember -- companies want people to be flexible, too.


Best of luck.

******************************************************************************
 
I recently attended a short interviewing workshop offered by the career
services at my university.  Some advice concerning how to respond to an 
interview questions where you are asked about your abilities in a field 
where you have little experience.  I feel that I have a tendency to talk 
about my weaknesses or to tell the interviewer that I don't have
experience in the area (instead of "bragging").  In short, I downplay
my abilities.  People with lesser abilities manage to sound far better
than I do.  The workshop coordinator suggested that I word a response 
along the lines of "Although my strenths are more in the area of XYZ 
(promote your strengths here), I feel certain that I could accomplish 
task ABC (the questioned area) also."  This is an alternative to my 
response of "I don't really have much experience with ABC, but I think 
I could learn it."
  
I think of this as giving a politicians answer -- praising my own 
abilities while lightly addressing the question.  

****************************************************************************

While I would agree that you might need to brag, I would not necessarily
say you need to do it about yourself.  If that makes you feel a bit
uncomfortable, think of it as bragging about the work.  I would find someone
explicitly bragging about themselves to be a real negative mark.  However
someone who extols the various good things about a project or product
stands a much better chance.  By extolling the good things about a project
you give the interviewer a glance into what you consider is good, and
it also gives you the opportunity to let them see your technical
understanding of the project.  

Someone who is too self-centered by come across as difficult to work
with, not a team player, etc.  However someone who is confident about
the work they have done and shows enthusiasm and pride in their work
will likely be enthusiastic about other work as well.

One problem I have sometimes seen with candidates I interview that don't
appear confident is a tendency to trivialize work they have done.
This could be your biggest pitfall.  Turn everything into a positive
experience for the interview.  Instead of saying "Oh, that little project.
That only took 2 weeks and only had to do this." Say, "That was a small
project, only taking 2 weeks, but it had some very interesting aspects.
It had to fit into the system in this way and couldn't affect this other
portion of the system.  I designed the module to be integrated like
this to meet those requirements.  The coding itself to perform the task
was not a big deal, but meeting the constraints made this small project
interesting."  If something is really so trivial that it does not have
any interesting aspects whatsoever, it has no business being listed on
your resume in the first place.

Good luck. 

***************************************************************************
	Good topic for systers!  Feel free to include my comments in your
summary with my name and email address.

	Interviewing is a skill that needs to be developed and practiced often.
Good for you for recognizing that.  What I've done in the past is do practice
interviews with friends and mentors.  I've both been the interviewer and the
interviewee, so my background about typical questions has grown.

	When I was just starting out in college, I interviewed with every
company that had any need for software engineers, regardless of locale.  This
helped me practice.  In preparation for any interview, I study my resume
and plan how I will respond with more detail when asked.  I may highlight
how the work was cutting edge and why, how tight a schedule we were under and
how we managed it, how pleased the customer was when receiving the product,
how this project dramatically increased the size of project I could now handle,
etc.  The resume will 'open doors' for you, and your planned responses will 
propel you into the 'room of opportunities'.

	Perhaps there are professors or career counselors at school who can
assist with your preparation for interviews, and coach you on how to improve
them.  Perhaps there are business people affiliated with the school who could
assist.  Keep looking, and don't take 'no' for an answer.  Good luck...

*******************************************************************************

Prepare and practice.  Know about the organization you're interviewing 
with and have some questions ready.  Enlist friends, collegues, etc. to
play the role of interviewer (friendly, hostile, aggressive, passive)
and try some dry runs.  

Your resume lists your key technical accomplishments, but you'll need
to expand on those that become relevant during the interview.  Don't
assume that the interviewer has picked up and/or understood everything
on your resume.  What sounds like boasting to you, is just helping the
interviewer put your role in its proper perspective.  What were your 
contributions, how much responsibility did you have, what was your 
budget, where your projects on time, what levels of customers/internal
people/outside groups did you have to address, etc., are much more 
informative than saying you work on such-and-such a project.   If you 
have a company that you REALLY want to work with, try going on some 
trial interviews elsewhere first, so you're more in the swing of things
by the time the important interview comes along.

You are probably not at risk of coming across as a braggart, but if 
you're worried, just pay attention to the interviewer's questions,
answer them, and use whatever opportunities arise to highlight your 
assets.  From my own expience overly confident interviewees consistently
tend not to answer the questions asked, but instead just keep spouting
off about how wonderful they are.  

******************************************************************************

One thing that my company does in interviewing to get a different
folks to talk about themselves is to realize some folks talk best
in first person, other's in third person.  This is particularly
true for people of different ethnic backgrounds that are taught either
not to boast or not to speak for superiors (thus the need to quote
peers).

so we ask:

1) Tell me what you think of yourself.

2) Tell me what your last/current manager/advisor would say about you.

3) Tell me what a peer or subordinate would say about you.

In general, I feel better about quoting a peer or advisor as saying
that I've done a great job than I do just stating it as a fact.

You may want to save a set of quotes to use in the interview.
Also, realize that this person interviewing you is comparing your comments
to other 'more boastful' comments, so going from modest to proud still will
leave you a big distance from folks who go proud to egotistical  :-)

*******************************************************************************

All the information about interviews is very interesting, and reminded me
of a book I've used to prepare for interviews, presentations, and other
situations.

I got this book from the library and liked it so much that I bought my
own copy. It contains very practical suggestions for speaking confidently
in any situation, including presentations at work, presenting papers at 
conferences, giving courses, asking and answering questions, job interviews, 
and everyday conversation.

It is organized in short sections of one or two pages each on various topics,
such as how to use transparencies in a presentation or how to sit during a job 
interview. It is very comprehensive and even includes difficult topics such as
"I don't know how to change the subject when I'm bored to tears", "My co-worker
stands too close", and "I spilled spaghetti sauce on my shirt at lunch".
