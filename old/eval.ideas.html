<H2>Course Evaluation Ideas</H2>
Here are some suggestions for filling out the Computer Science Majors'
Committee course evaluation form:
<hr>
</center>
<UL>
<LI> <STRONG>Sign your evaluation.</STRONG>
Your signature will lend credibility to your comments.  It will also give
readers of your evaluation an idea of where you're coming from (if they
know you).  If you feel you must make a comment anonymously, consider
filling out two evaluations: a signed evaluation and an anonymous one.
<LI> <STRONG>Courses change.</STRONG>
When writing your comments, consider that professors try to improve on their
courses each time around.  Instead of discussing particulars that will surely
be different the next time around, spend time writing about a course's general
approach or philosophy and it's general structure, which will probably remain
constant with time.
<LI> <STRONG>Describe the course.</STRONG>
What do you wish you knew about the course before you decided to take it?
What are the assignments like?  What is the main focus of the course?  What
are some issues that are not addressed in the course that fall under the
subject of the course?
<LI> <STRONG>Describe the professor.</STRONG>
What is the professor's teaching style?
