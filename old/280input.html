<li> <code>comments = Exercise 8 in lab two is kind of vague about
the kind of data that can be passed in.  It seems that 
one should only be checking for a list of number lists 
(ie it isn't clear that  imbedded lists should be considered
an all-numlists - such as

  (((1) 2) (3 4))

p.s. keep up the good work, the labs keep getting
better and better! miles above the 275 labs! :)</code>
