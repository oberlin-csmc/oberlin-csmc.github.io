<H2>Why is the CSMC using a non-CS machine to drive the comment form?</H2>
Fill-out forms require a script to handle their submitted output,
and currently scripts on the cs.oberlin.edu machines must go through
a review process (because of possible security holes).  Our script began
this process on November 14. <P>

Update (11/23/94) - The faculy decided today to allow the student
public administrators (in communication with Rich and Chuck)
to install scripts.  Once this mechanism is
in place, it should be much easier to get scripts running
at cs.oberlin.edu. <P>

Update (1/12/95) - Bob asked Chuck on Dec. 7 to create a public
directory for httpd scripts.  Chuck reported today that Rich
is taking care of creating the directory.  We still have no
mechanism for creating scripts. <P>

Update (1/31/95) - Public httpd script directory created.  The script
will be on www.cs.oberlin.edu in the next few days. <P>
