<H1>CSMC Minutes</H1>
<H2>11 September 1997</h2>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>The following items were discussed:
<UL><tt>
<LI>There was quite a bit of concern expressed over the addition of the computer
graphic on the <a href="http://www.cs.oberlin.edu">Computer Science Home Page</a>.
In addition, it was decided that several of the student-run pages should be revamped,
including<UL>
<LI><a href="http://www.cs.oberlin.edu/students/csmc/">The CSMC pages</a> -- <a href="mailto:nfallen@cs.oberlin.edu">Niki</a> volunteered.
<LI>The public pages -- Jasmin, Kali, and Dave Jacobs volunteered.
</UL>
<br>
<LI>It would be a good idea to code some sort of widget for the PPros in
the lab to reboot them, so that we wouldn't have to keep restarting them
to switch b/w Win95 and BSDi.  This should not be a security risk, but
requires some effort.  <a href="mailto:jlee@cs.oberlin.edu">Jonathon
Lee</a> is looking into it. <BR><br>
<LI>A concern about allowing all CS students (from students of 150 on through the upper-level courses) to use the lab after regular King Building hours was raised, but the general consensus was not hope a problem didn't arise since in the past, most peopl
e don't actually ask for lab passes.
<BR><br>
<LI>There is a very strong feeling that <a href="http://www-ts.cs.oberlin.edu/">Third Stream</a> should be funded seperately from the CS department, because our faculty are now teaching Third Stream courses.  However, it was brought up that Third Stream b
rings a lot of money into the department.  It would be nice if the college thought CS was important in its own right and would fund us.
<BR><br>
<LI>UNIX/EMACS night:  Wednesday 9.17.97.  9 pm.  Free Pizza.  Be there.  Organized by
<a href="mailto:djacobs@cs.oberlin.edu">Dave Jacobs</a> and <a href="mailto:jlee@cs.oberlin.edu">Jonathon Lee</a>.
<BR><br>
<LI>The Public Group:  Public was pretty small but now has more members.  The list is:
<UL><br>
	<LI><a href="mailto:bushnell@cs.oberlin.edu">Alan Bushnell</a>
	<LI><a href="mailto:kgriffin@cs.oberlin.edu">Kali Griffin</a>
	<LI><a href="mailto:jhaber@cs.oberlin.edu">Jason Haber</a>

	<LI><a href="mailto:sthacker@cs.oberlin.edu">Siddarth Thacker</a>
</UL>
<BR>
<LI>Dave Jacobs has offered to fix Freshinit for UNIX/EMACS night.
<BR><br>
<LI><strong>T-SHIRTS!!!!!!</strong>  We need designs.  If you make any cool ones, mail them <a href="mailto:nfallen@cs.oberlin.edu">to me</a> and we'll consider them for this year's
Computer Science Majors' T-SHIRT. 
<BR><br><LI>POCKET is a community-oriented computer group.  They work in the local high school and Early Childhood Center teaching about technology (at a semi-low level) as well as helping install various things.  If you are <strong>at all interested</str
ong>, please talk to 
<a href="mailto:djacobs@cs.oberlin.edu">Dave Jacobs</a>.
<BR><br><LI><STRONG>GEEK NIGHT</strong> is being arranged by <a href="mailto:jkirsch@cs.oberlin.edu">James Kirsch</a>.  It's scheduled for next week, so far.
<BR><br><LI>The ACM Programming contest is being held November 7th and we'd love to get a team (or two) together for this year's competition.  There is a lot of interest so far, and there'd be lots of cool people to go with.  If you're interested, <a href
="mailto:rhyspj@cs.oberlin.edu">email Prof. Rhys Price Jones</a>.
<br><br><li>Something needs to be done about the number of permanent faculty we have for the CS (3) and Third Stream (1) departments.  This will involve a lot of networking, talking to deans and alumni and <STRONG>parents</strong> among other things.  <a 
href="mailto:morpheus@cs.oberlin.edu">Dave Kammer</a> has offered to draft an outline of strategies we should approach and in what order.  If you have suggestions, please email him.
<br><br><li>We need to publicize the <a href="mailto:help@cs.oberlin.edu">help@cs.oberlin.edu</a> mailing list.  It's full of people, fast and easy to use.  Just ask your question via email, and you'll usually get a reply within a few hours.
<br><br><li>There is some movement toward creating a student-run web-site for the CS pages.
