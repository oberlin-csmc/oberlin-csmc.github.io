<li> <code>Comments = Bob really is a brilliant instructor.  For example, today we
were working on a tictactoe game that we've been doing for 3 
weeks (it was due about 1 week ago), and we couldn't figure
out what was wrong with our decision tree.  Bob took one 
look at the thousands of lines of code (or so it seemed) and 
knew exactly what was wrong.  Anyway, I just thought I'd
mention that.  About the course, I think it's great, even if
already studied most of it in AP Computer Science.  And, if
you can't make it to class, Bob's lectures are his chapters
-- just read it for yourself =).</code>
