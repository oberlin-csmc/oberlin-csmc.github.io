<li> <code>Comments = This is a well-designed course and Bob teaches it well.
There could probably be more modern topics included in the
course, but the material covered is a good survey of
fundamentals.  A fast pace - nice change from almost every
other cs course I've taken.  Fun assignments that are hard
but not impossible.</code>

<li> <code>Comments = This was a good course in general, and I'm glad I took it. 

Be prepared for a good bit of X coding; if you don't know 

how already, getting started early is a good idea.  There's 

quite a bit of grody math around the middle of the course; 

I hit a slump there when classes consisted of mostly 

copying down the derivations of formulas. But the beginning 

and end of the course were fun: we learned lots of 

techniques, and got the concepts we needed. 



The assignments are, in general, one of the best parts of 

this course. Bob encourages you to kind of be creative 

with them, which can be fun. Try not to get burned out on 

them too early, though. </code>
