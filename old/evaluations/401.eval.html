<ul>

<li> <code>Course = 401. Honors</code>

<li> <code>Semester Month = Spring</code>

<li> <code>Semester Year = 1995</code>

<li> <code>Comments = I have some concerns which I'd like to address. There
have been some serious problems with the organizations of the honors
program in the Computer Science Program. <P>

<UL>
<LI>Students recieved no outline or syllabus describing
        what was expected of them. In addition, the department did not
        come close to the time-table that might have been expected to
        show up in such a syllabus.    <P>
<LI>The CS department did not find an honors examiner until
        *after* spring break.  Even after they had found an examiner,
	they did not inform the students about the expected dates of
	the written and oral exams until just three days beforehand. 
<LI>The CS department did not communicate with the students <P>
        even when it finally did know on what day or week important
        events would occur. For example, when we (the students) were
        trying to find out when the exams would be, we asked for an
        estimate within a month, or within a week, of when the exam
        would be. The department couldn't tell us that. Finally, they
        gave us *three* days notice about when we'd have to take
        the written exam, and then didn't even inform us when they
        found out that it would have to be postponed until after the
        weekend. I had to send mail directly to the honors examiner in
	order to find out what was happening.  <P>
<LI>The CS department has made it clear to us that the due
        date for our honors thesis is just about anytime this
        summer. This means that the thesis is due *after* the
        final deadline for all grades for seniors to be handed in. In
        addition, the honors examiner will have no information about
        our honors projects. It seems a little strange that the
        determination of whether we get honors, high honors, or
        highest honors is not affected in the slightest by our honors
        project or honors thesis.   <P>
</UL>

I would like to ask that you keep an eye on the CS department's
progress in finding an honors examiner next year, and I strongly urge     
you to investigate the organization of the program.</code>
