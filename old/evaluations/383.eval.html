<ul>

<li> <code>Course = 383. Theory of Computer Science</code>

<li> <code>Professor = Jones</code>

<li> <code>Semester Month = Spring</code>

<li> <code>Semester Year = 1995</code>

<li> <code>Comments = Very unimpressive.  Rhys teaches this class at the lowest
common denominator, moving far too slowly and using far
too many examples of easy material, some of which we've
been working with since cs151.  He is often not well
prepared for the class, and in addition frequently spends
lots of time on unimportant tangents.  The text is solid,
though, and the problem sets are challenging.  Ah, if
only our classroom experience had kept up.</code>

<li> <code>Comments = Progress has been slow so far.  We've spent a good deal of
time covering state machines.  That's seemed like a waste
of time because I (and everyone else in the class) received
a healthy introduction to state machines in 151, so a lot
of what we have done has been review.
I don't care much for Rhys's practice of always delivering
impromptu lectures.  He doesn't have much in the way of
lecture notes with him while he's addressing the class.
This is no problem when he knows what he wants to say and
thus doesn't need notes, but sometimes he's not able to
give a good lecture strictly from memory.  On these
occasions, class becomes a waste of time for the students
as Rhys tries to figure out what's going on.  Having
lecture notes to fall back on would be much appreciated as
this happens with unpleasant frequency.</code>

<li> <code>Comments = I'll revise what I said earlier.  Computability theory
is very interesting, and Rhys is good at teaching it.
It's really the only part of the course for which his
lectures really added anything to my experience of reading
the text and doing the assignments.  BUT WE ONLY SPENT
TWO WEEKS ON IT!!  As I said before, the introduction to
machine basics is far too slow for my liking.</code>
