<ul>

<li> <code>Course = 280. Computer Science IV</code>

<li> <code>Professor = Jones</code>

<li> <code>Professor = Ruehr</code>

<li> <code>Semester Month = Spring</code>

<li> <code>Semester Year = 1995</code>

<li> <code>Comments = Thankfully, this class has proved to be a vast improvement
over Cs275 last semester, which suffered from several
problems.  I think this is mostly due to the fact that the
class is being divided into three sections with one prof
each section, rather than three teachers all the time.
My favorite part of Cs280 is the textbook - Elements of
Programming Languages is a great textbook, and I have
learned the most from this course through doing the
exercises in EOPL (although this is not required).
I also appreciate the alternate lectures brought into
class (lazy evaluation, graph reduction), but think that
a little too much time was spent on them.
My major complaint - I am not challenged by this class.
The labs give way too much for free - I would learn more if
I had to actually _work_ on the labs.  The labs are well
constructed, but should have the student do more work and
perhaps let the student do some experimenting before being shown how to do things.</code>
