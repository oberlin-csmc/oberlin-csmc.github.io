<H1>Interview Styles</H1>

There are three basic styles of interviews that most interviewers
follow.

The directed interview is the most frequently used style for the first
interview.  According to H. Anthony Medley, author of Sweaty Palms:
The Neglected Art of Being Interviewed, the interviewer using this
style works from an outline and asks specific questions within a
certain time frame.  He or she usually has a predetermined checklist
on which he or she notes each candidate's responses.  This predominate
style is impersonal but challenging to the interviewee. <P>

The second tye of interview style is the nondirective.  It usually is
unstructured and allows the interviewee to talk about his or her
choice of topics.  The questons are broad and general. It is a format
which allows you to take control of the interview, stressing your
strengths and avoiding your weaknesses. <P>

The third style is the stress interview.  If you understand the
purpose of this type of interview, it will help you feel more at ease.
In this interview, the interviewer may lapse into long periods of
silence or have an unfriendly or brusque attitude.  Sometimes the
interviewer stares at you without blinking an eye, but at other times
he or she simply ignores you and concentrates on taking notes. Kirby
W. Stanat, author of Job Hunting Secrets and Tactics, says the purpose
of this type of interview is that the recruiter is trying to find out
one of two things: (1) How far you can be pushed before you assert
yourself? or (2) How do you assert yourself?
