<H2>Preparing For the Job Search</H2>
</center>
<dd>Because the job-search may be a lengthy process, it should be 
approached with the same understanding and organization as with any important 
project.  Prior to beginning the job-search campaign, there are several basic 
questions which you should ask yourself:   <P>
<center>
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr>
<td>
<OL>
<LI> 
      Am I in the right frame of mind to begin this search?  
	Have you resolved the negative feelings about your termination?   
	Have you regained control of your emotional highs and lows?  If not,  
	concentrate on the positive aspects of your job-search, it can be a 
	positive and rewarding experience.
<LI>       Have I established realistic goals?
	Do you know what kind of work and what position you want?  Do you 
	want to, or can you   relocate?  Do you know who you want to work for 
	and where?  If you have not established any goals, you might use the 
	following as a guideline for developing some preliminary goals:
<UL>
<LI>        Size of company?
<LI>        Its products and, or services?
<LI>        Is it in the private or public sector?
<LI>        Its corporate image and reputation?
<LI>        Its annual or projected growth?
<LI>        Its geographical location?
</UL>

<LI>       Am I in need of professional counseling?
	If you are suffering from chronic depression and still feel stunned 
	and desperate several months after the loss of your job, you may want 
	to seek expert help to work through your problem.  Frequently, just a 
	few sessions with a counselor will help you regain your old 
	confidence and drive to succeed.
<LI>       Am I prepared to work hard at the job-search?
	An effective job-search is a full-time job.  You will need to spend 
	at least four to six hours a day on the search.  You will be your own 
	marketing manager, public relations expert, and administrative 
	assistant.  It is up to you to do it all.  Be sure to keep good 
	records so as not to duplicate your efforts.
<LI>       Am I ready to start my search with confidence?
	Using the results of your personal asset evaluation, review the 
	positive aspects of your career and accomplishments.  This exercise 
	will serve to reinforce your sense of self-worth and give focus to 
	what sort of position you are most qualified for.
<LI>       Do I have the necessary technical and administrative support for my 
	job-search?  Do you have an orderly place to work?  If you can't 
	type, do you have access to a word  processor or a paid secretary or 
	devoted friend who will stick with you and help?  Obtain white or 
	cream color rag-content stationary with easily readable typeface for 
	your name and address.  Also, you will need to have office supplies, 
	such as:  scissors, small postage scale, stamps, manila envelopes, 
	pens and pencils, typewriter of some kind, typing paper, yellow pads, 
	blank mailing labels, Scotch tape, and three-by-five index cards.

<H3>Developing A Marketing Strategy</H3>

	What is a marketing strategy?  It is your plan or means of seeking 
and getting a job by using:<p>
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr>
<td>
<UL>
<LI>        Published openings and non-published positions (hidden jobs).
<LI>       Executive search firms and employment agencies.
<LI>        Target company mailings and industry mailings.
<LI>        Personal contact network.
<LI>        Employment advertisements.
</UL>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
	Even while you are preparing your marketing tools and becoming 
proficient in interviewing, you should be gathering information on target 
companies which you wish to approach during your job campaign.
<hr>								     
<A NAME=openings>	       
<H3>Published Openings</H3>
</center>
<dd>A published opening is a job vacancy that has been officially declared 
open within a company.  Typically, this is announced by the 
issuance of a personnel requisition through the personnel department.  It is 
made known publicly through some kind of publication or solicitation in a 
newspaper, magazine, or by posting within the company.  These are called 
published, even though they sometimes are hard to uncover.  At this point, 
the company is actively taking steps to fill the position.  Therefore, if you 
contact the company and appear to be qualified, you will have a good chance 
of getting an interview.<center>
<hr>
<A NAME=hidden>
<H3>Hidden Jobs</H3>

	Hidden jobs refer to a part of the job market in which the positions 
have not been advertised or made known to the general public.  Some examples 
include:
<p>
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr>
<td>
<UL>
<LI>        A department that has fallen behind in its assigned 
		responsibility and requires immediate additional staffing.
<LI>        Jobs which are created because of the development of a new 
		product, service or company growth, and expansion.
<LI>        Confidential employee replacement requirement.

<H2>Planning your Job Search Campaign</H2>

	The following sections will discuss specific courses of action for 
seeking out both types of jobs, the published ones and the hidden ones.
<hr>
<A NAME=employment>
<H3>Employment Agencies</H3>

	Almost all companies, at one time or another, make use of employment 
agencies to support their personnel department activities and requirements.  
When dealing with employment agencies it is important to know:<p>
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr>
<td>
<UL>
<LI>        Employment agencies typically deal with jobs from entry level 
		to $50,000 per year.
<LI>        Most of them specialize in certain types of positions or 
		vocations.
<LI>        A few will require you to sign a contract that commits you to 
		pay a fee based upon a certain percent of your income after 
		you accept a job.  This fee can be from 10% to 15% of your 
		starting yearly salary.  Even if you quit your job you will 
		still be required to pay.
<LI>        It is becoming more common for the employer to pay the agency 
		fee.  If using an agency, make sure the employer has agreed 
		to pay the fee.  
<LI>        The amount of effort an employment agency spends on trying to 
		get you a job is a function of how marketable they feel you 
		are.  If you fit one or more of their client's profiles, they 
		will arrange for interviews right away.
<LI>        Remember, employment agencies make their money by placing as 
		many individuals as possible, in the shortest period of time.  
		Be cautious, they may push you to take something that you 
		don't really want.  This is frequently done so they can 
		increase their volume of placements.
<LI>        Be aware that agencies can also work against you by 
		soliciting companies which you have already interviewed with 
		and presenting other candidates they represent.  Never let 
		them know what your job-search campaign plan is and don't let 
		them know you are covering the market on your own.

<dd>You should also know that when working through an employment agency, 
the prospective employer will be required to pay a fee of 20% to 30% of your 
first year's salary.  Given the choice between two equally qualified 
individuals, the company will most likely select the one which has no fee 
associated with employment.  It is important to use agencies as ONE of the 
strategies of your job-search.  They are aware of open positions and can get 
you interviews.  They can also provide you with feedback on your interviewing 
skills and how a company might react to you. <center> 
<hr>
<A NAME=search>
<H3>Search Firms</H3>
</center>
<dd>Search firms work primarily for the employer.  They work on either a 
retainer or contingency basis.  Employers might pay them a retainer to locate 
qualified candidates for a specific position.  Other searches are done on a 
contingency basis where the firm only receives a fee if the company hires an 
employee they have represented. <P>

<dd>Once you submit your resume, the search firm will contact you by 
telephone if your background matches the needs of an ongoing search 
assignment.  During the initial telephone conversation, the identity of the 
prospective employer will not be revealed.  Nevertheless, sufficient 
information will be exchanged to give you an idea about the company.  
(i.e., size, industry, services, products, location, etc.).<center>
<hr>
<A NAME=newspapers>
<H3>Newspaper Advertisements</H3>
</center>
<dd>Large metropolitan newspapers have ads in their business section 
which lists job openings.  In some cases the name of the company is concealed 
with only a box number given to respond to.  <p>

<dd>Although answering ads in the newspaper is a somewhat low-yield 
effort, there may be an occasional opening that is particularly suited to 
your experience and education.  When responding to these ads, the following 
should be taken into consideration.<center>
<p>
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr>
<td>
<UL>
<LI> 
       Identify the key assets the advertiser is seeking and briefly 
		list them on paper.
<LI>        Identify as many of your own assets and skills which 
		reasonably match the stated requirements.
<LI>        Use both lists of needs and assets to address the position in 
		the first part of your response letter.    
<LI>        The rest of your response letter should be short and to the 
		point, and refer to an attached resume.
<LI>        Avoid the issue of salary requirements by leaving it out 
		altogether or if required, by giving a broad salary range.
<LI>        A particular ad in which you are interested should be answered 
		whether you are qualified, over qualified, or under qualified 
		for it.  Companies rarely find a perfect match to their stated 
		requirements.
<LI>        Answer advertisements from companies which you might have 
		responded to before.  Companies generally don't have very 
		accurate tracking and filing systems for applicants.  Remember, 
		one letter expressing no interest does not mean no interest 
		forever.
<LI>        Respond to companies who run large advertisements and do a 
		considerable amount of hiring.  Even if you don't fit the 
		requirements for the advertised opening, you may fit another 
		unadvertised opening.
<LI>        Don't overlook blind or box number only advertisements.  Even 
		though the success rate is minimal, they sometimes do pan out.

<H3>Targeted Companies</H3>
</center>
<dd>Target companies are the ones which you <EM> really want to work for</EM>.  They 
 should be chosen according to the goals and requirements that you have 
 developed, including location, working climate, profitability, opportunity 
 for promotion, pay scales, etc.  These companies should be approached with a 
 tailor-made job-search campaign.  Remember, the bigger the market for your 
 particular skills or pay level, the more selective you can be in defining 
 your target companies.
