<LI>Job Description:  <BR>	 
Hi,   <BR>
My name is Mark Saltzman.  I graduated from Oberlin in '90 with a
degree in something quite unlike cs.  However, I am now gainfully
employed at a small software company in Canton, OH.  I would like to
do some kind of recruiting at Oberlin for programmers soon, but I am
not sure that the office of career development will be able to get the
message out to the people I want to talk to (I know that I might have
ignored them when I was a student).  I would like to do some kind of
mailing to graduating seniors, not necessarily cs majors, who are
interested in creative software development in a casual environment.
Please contact me if this seems like a good idea to you, or forward
this message to someone who might be interested.  If you would like
more information about me or my company please feel free to contact me
