<H1>Interview Structure</H1>

Most 30-minute interviews consist of three parts: the introduction,
the body and the close.  The introducton generally includes the first
5 minutes of the interview.  It is designed to put you and the
recruiter at ease.  A question about your college activities, the
weather, or sports are topics often discussed during the first few
minutes. <P>

The body of the interview (usually 20 minutes) is divided into two
sections. The first 15 minutes of this time frame allows the
interviewer, usingquestions and answers, to evaluate your employment
qualifications.  The next 5-minute portion is designed to give you
information about the organization.  Also, the interviewer will
usually answer any questions you may have. <P>

In the final 5 minutes (the close), the interviewer will give you the
information needed to insure a clear understanding of what is to
happen next, i.e., he or she will request a completed applicaton form,
or he or she will contact you concerning a second interview or a plant
trip. Also, once you leave theroom, the interviewer will make
additional notes about you and your qualifications.
