                           THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION

     "RESEARCH EXPERIENCES FOR UNDERGRADUATES" PROGRAM


                                                Introduction

The National Science Foundation makes possible a number of
opportunities for undergraduates to join research projects each
summer.  This allows students to experience first-hand how basic
research is done, and to contribute consequentially. The principal
support by NSF of such activities is through the Research Experiences
for Undergraduates Program. REU "Sites" are established in all fields
of science, mathematics, and engineering. Each Site consists of a group
of ten or so undergraduates, who work in the research programs of the
host institution. Students are in general accepted from throughout the
country.  Each student is assigned to a specific research project,
where he/she works closely with the faculty, post-docs, and graduate
students. In addition, seminars, lunch meetings, and social functions
are organized to facilitate interaction between the undergraduates.
Students are granted stipends, and in some cases assistance with
housing and travel. Women and members of under- represented minorities
are particularly urged to apply.

We attach lists of all the REU Sites and of some other activities
supported by NSF that have similar summer programs. Some of the lists
are for activities that were in operation in 1994; most of these
activities will also be active in 1995.  Other lists are up-dated to
include 1995 changes.  These lists will be further up-dated, so they
should be checked periodically. Contact each Site directly for specific
information, and for application procedures and deadlines.

                   SUMMER RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES
                             FOR UNDERGRADUATES
               IN PHYSICS, MATERIALS, AND ASTRONOMY



The National Science Foundation makes possible a number of
opportunities for undergraduates to join research projects each
summer.  This allows students to experience first-hand how basic
research is done, and to contribute consequentially. Women and members
of under-represented minorities are particularly urged to apply.

The principal support by NSF of such activities is through the Research
Experiences for Undergraduates Program.  REU Sites are established in
all fields of science, mathematics, and engineering. REU Sites in
physics, materials, and astronomy are supported by three NSF
Divisions:

*The Division of Physics supports Sites that span all areas of physics
research with a few including some components of astronomy and
astrophysics.

*The Division of Materials Research supports Sites that focus
principally on research in condensed matter physics and materials.

*The Division of Astronomical Sciences supports Sites that comprise
principally research in astronomy and astrophysics, with a few
including research in some aspects of physics.

In addition, three groups of Laboratories have summer programs that
involve undergraduates in research in physics, materials, or
astronomy:

*The Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers and the
*Materials Research Laboratories have broad-ranging research programs
in condensed matter physics and materials.

*The Science and Technology Centers are each focussed on a range of
research indicated by their titles.

We attach lists of these various Sites, Laboratories, and Centers that
will host groups of undergraduates in the summer of 1994. Each of the
following institutions will take in a group of (usually) ten to fifteen
undergraduates, who will participate in the on-going research of the
host department or laboratory. Unless otherwise noted, students will be
accepted from throughout the country. Each student will be assigned to
a specific research project, where he/she will work closely with the
faculty, post- docs, and graduate students. In addition, seminars,
lunch meetings, and social functions will be organized to facilitate
interaction between the undergraduates. Students will be granted
stipends, and in some cases assistance with housing and travel. Those
interested should contact the institutions directly for application
forms and details of the research topics open to undergraduates.

Further information about ongoing and new activities can be obtained by
inquiring of the NSF Division of Astronomical Sciences [(703) 306-1819;
jwright@nsf.gov], Materials Research [(703) 306-1814; rreynik@nsf.gov],
or Physics [(703) 306-1809; rsinclai@nsf.gov].

                                   SUMMER 1994/95

The following thirty-three REU Sites were active in the summer of 1994.
It is planned that most or all of them will be active in 1995. Also, we
list seven new Sites, most or all of which will be initiated in 1995.
Inquire of each Site as to its current status.

Most of these  Sites are based on the full range of research of the
indicated departments or laboratories and included both experimental
and theoretical activities. A few of these contain projects in
astronomy or astrophysics. The remainder [marked (*)] are based on the
research of a more specialized laboratory or facility, have a special
topical focus, or are aimed at a particular group of students (as
indicated).
