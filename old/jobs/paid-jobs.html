<H2>CS331: Grader</H2>
<H3>Contact: Fritz Ruehr</H3>

<UL>
<LI> Job Title: Grader
<LI> Course Title: Compilers
<LI> Instructor: fritz
<LI> Expected Hours/Week: 5-10
<LI> Number of Students Needed: 1
<LI> Prerequisites: 

  Computer science major with experience in C programming required.
Passage of Compilers course (or non-Obie equivalent) with good grade
preferred. Passage of Theory and Computer Organization with good grades 
a reasonable substitute. Responsible work habits a must.


<LI> Job Description &amp; Responsibilities:

  Ideally, I would like to hire someone who can help grade compiler
projects with an eye for compiler-specific content ... but there may
be few people available with the right background for this. As an
alternative, I'd also be happy to have someone who can run the
students' project code on test suites, summarize any problems and
maintain records on basic performance, late hand-ins, etc. <P>

  In the former case more work would be available, since more 
substantive grading would be involved. In the latter case, the
workload would be less and the job would be less demanding. If
either situation would suit you, please apply.
