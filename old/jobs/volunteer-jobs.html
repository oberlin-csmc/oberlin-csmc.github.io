<H2>Gnusoft: Administrator</H2>
<H3>Supervisor: Chuck Van Tilburg</H3>

<UL>
<LI> Job Title: Gnusoft Administrator
<LI> Person to Contact if Interested: ctilburg
<LI> Expected Hours/Week:
     The work load for this job really isn't too heavy, and Gnu does a
     great job of making installation easy. You'll learn about
     software maintenance and help out everyone on this system :). 

<LI> Number of Students Needed: 1
<LI> Prerequisites:
<UL>
<LI> a) preferably no later and no earlier than a junior level 
		student so there is some continutity and tenure in 
		the position.  This is not a rigid item but is a
		good suggested start.  Don't let grade level keep you
		from applying.
<LI> 	b) CS major
<LI> 	c) Some experience with GNU software and/or getting/building
		software packages from the network for multiple 
		architectures, sharing as much as possible (public 
		experience is exactly what I am talking about here).
<LI> 	d) documentation skills; you must leave some kind of documentation 
		for your successor that is a reasonable attempt to be 
		up-to-date.
</UL>
<LI> Job Description &amp; Reponsibilities: 

     Gnusoft is in dire need of a new student volunteer for next
     semester. This is a great opportunity to learn some of the
     practical paspects of computer science.  

Since Gnu utilities are heavily depended upon, this must be done
carefully and responsibly. The software needs to be installed on all
platforms reliably. Chuck will help out, and instruct the volunteer. 

The volunteer will be asked to:

<UL>
<LI> 	a) Get, build, install and TEST: GNU and ONLY GNU software for
		the gnusoft area on all platforms for CS.  Since we
		rely upon GNU software so much, there is little room
		for mistakes.  Everything should be done incrementally
		and nothing should be attempted without a reasonably
		clear understanding of the dependencies involved; we
		share as much non-architecture dependant stuff as we
		can. 
<LI> 	b) respond to all gnusoft email; in effect, supporting such 
		software.  Participate in gnusoft usenet news groups
		and interact with the GNU software developers as
		necessary.
<LI> 	c) ability to work without supervision, but responsible to the
		CS systems manager (ctilburg).  Since I have not constructed
		the gnusoft environment, but it is loosely based on occs'
		general multi-platform symbolic linking, I may be able to 
		help get the candidate started, but I cannot guarantee any 
		level of help.
</UL>


<LI> How to apply: If you're interested, feel free to ask kfogel or
noel about their experiences as gnusoft volunteers. Also, please send
a message detailing why you want the job and why you think you are
qualified to do it to ctilburg as kind of an essay type thing; no
limit, but keep it succinct, please.  Chuck will collect the applications
and forward them to Bob Geitz and CSMC for comments.  Then Bob will
make the decision.

     Interest in public utilities relating to the system and the

<LI> Job Description &amp; Reponsibilities:

Public is a place where users can put programs, images, or text that
they think are useful, interesting, or fun, where other people will
see them and be able to use them. <P>

We feel that programmers flourish in an environment where they can
share ideas and programs with one another.  We love it when one person
gets a neat idea, reads some manual pages, writes a neat program, and
makes it available to everyone; and other people see the program and
say "Wow, that's nifty!  I never thought of that/I didn't know you
could do that!" <P>

For more info, send mail to <TT>public</TT>.  We welcome suggestions,
praise, and comestibles. <P>

Guide</A>? <P>

The public group members will be happy to help you learn how to do
things if you don't know how.  Their basic philosophy is, make
learning possible and make information accessible. <P>
