<H1>Difficult and Illegal Questions</H1>

Anyone who has had a number of employment interviews has experienced
the difficulty of responding to questions which appear to be illegal.
These questions may arise because the employer is unaware of the equal
opportunity laws and regulations or, in fact, intends to ignore the
nondiscremination requirements of civil rights legislation.  Such
questions pose a dilemma for job seekers.  Refusal to respond will
likely damage your chances of a successful interview.  On the other
hand, responding to these kinds of questons may divulge information
which could be used to exclude you.  This section provides examples of
questions which potentially discriminate against an applicant based on
sex, race, or other protected class characteristics. Your responses
should be formulated to provide the relevant information the
interviewer needs in making a decision. <P>

Problem questions which have occurred in interviews with women and
minorities are listed below. The suggested appropriate responses that
follow are not "pat" answers. It is important to find a way to handle
difficult situations.  Appropriate use of humor might work for one
individual, while confronting the interviewer would work better for
another individual.  Your career goals will also influence the way in
which you choose to respond.  Keep these things in mind as you
organize your thoughts.

<HR>

Q.  Do you know how to type? (When applying for a managerial position) <P>

A.  I did not understand that typing was required for this position; I
assumed that this service would be available to assist me in my
managerial role.

<HR>
Q.  What will your marital status be in the future? <P>

A.  I do not anticipate any change in my marital status in the near
future, and I do not believe it is related to my job performance.

<HR>
Q.  Are you married?  If yes, do you plan to go where your spouse
   locates employment after graduation? <P>

A.  I am looking for a career opportunity which I feel your
organization can provide.  If I am hired, my spouse will attempt to
locate a position near my job. 

<HR>
Q.  Are you planning to have a family? <P>

A.  I have no present plans for having children, but if I do, I would
expect to take a short leave of absence and return to my career.

<HR>
Q.  Do you think people find it difficult to work for a woman? A minority? <P>

A.  If a supervisor has received the proper training and has a mature,
sincere approach to supervising employees, which I feel I have, then
potential difficulties can be overcome.

<HR> 
Q.  Do you think that the morale and harmony among peers could be
adversely affected by the presence of a woman or minority in an
administrative positon?

A.  If employees perform their jobs conscientiously and relate to
others on a professional basis, I feel that there should be no more
problems than those associated with any group of peers.

<HR> 
Q.  Do you feel that as a member of a minority group you would have
problems living in a consevative community?

A.  I have been a member of a minority group all of my life and feel
able to cope with any difficulties and problems I may encounter.

<HR> 

As other difficult questions or problems arise, you may want to
discuss them with the Career Development and Placement Coordinator.
Most states have enforcement agencies which receive and investigate
complaints of discrimination.  The name varies by state but usually
entails civil rights or human rights relations. In Iowa, it is the
Iowa Civil Rights Commission, 507 10th Street, Colony Building, Des
Moines, IA 50319.
