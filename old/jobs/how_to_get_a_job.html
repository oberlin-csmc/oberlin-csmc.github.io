Hiya.  Presumably you want a job or a WT project or a summer
job that pays big bucks, but are just starting out.  Good
luck.  The list of contacts I've made is what it is.  Please
don't abuse it, and please be aware that a lot of these
companies aren't hiring.  However, the larger companies
would probably love to look you over in a WT project or a
summer job.  Here's some random advice from someone who
hated doing this but got away with it anyway. <P>
 
OK.  So Career Development is only confusing you, and you're
afraid of Perry Boyles in the Business Initiatives office.
Don't be afraid of Mr. Boyles.  If you tell him what you're
after, he'll do whatever he can--it's his job.  On the other
hand, his business is big business and you may not want to
work for IBM.  So skip it.  You CAN get a job that you want
and like.  You may have to fork over some time and a bucket
of money, but hey, isn't it better than working for IBM? <P>
 
The resume is the easy part.  Cover letters are hateful, but
don't worry too much about them.  Make up a standard cover
letter and just change the address and date, and perhaps the
last paragraph in which you tell them the bad news that
you're going to beat on their door until they talk to you.
This letter may not even get your foot in the door. <P>
 
Classifieds are fine.  Remember that classified adds in big
cities commonly gather hundreds of resumes.  Still, it is
not futile to send yours in, nor is it futile to send your
resume in for a job for which you do not qualify, so long as
it is in a company you want to work for.  Your resume may
find its way to the right person, who may be nice enough to
call you, which may get you a job.  This could take a month
or more, but it can happen.  Really. <P>
 
The larger the company, the more BS you have to deal with
and the sooner you should get in touch.  ALWAYS attempt to
get a human being interested in you.  It can be tricky, but
people are generally very receptive to brilliant, spoiled
college students like you. <P>
 
A lot of cool companies don't have personel departments and
employ very few secretaries.  The upshot is that people are
very very busy, and have little time to get to know you.  It
is crucial that you keep everything very simple and precise,
whether on the telephone or in letters. <P>
 
Always ask.  About anything.  Be frank.  Say you don't know.
Say you do know.  If you can do it, say so.  etc. <P>
 
Fact:  you may find a company you really, really want to
work for, and they may not hire you, even after three
interviews and having sex with all of the appropriate
managers. <P>
 
Lesson:  never have sex with the person who will hire you --
have sex with their superiors. <P>

Hmm.  That's about all I can think of for now.  Go, ye and
be employed. <P>
 
Sturm und Drang, <P>
 
SKOT <P>
 
p.s. the more the merrier.
