<UL>
<LI> If you want personal attention from the graduate coordinator, please
give personal attention _to_ the graduate coordinator.  Don't send a single
form letter simultaneously to 200 institutions half of which you know nothing
about.  Look in Peterson's Guides and similar resources to try to identify
appropriate universities, and find out something about them before you
write to them.
<LI> Realize that American institutions, in general, will not accept
or reject you until you pay the $25 application fee.  (However, we
_can_ tell you in advance whether you are missing any clear minimum
requirements such as appropriate undergraduate degrees and the like.)
<LI> Even at minor universities, admission in computer-related fields is
surprisingly competitive, and assistantships are even more competitive.

Hi,  <P>

My name is Jen Mankoff, I'm a student at Oberlin College and I'm
looking for some information about Columbia's graduate computer
science program. Specifically, could you tell me where I could find
out more information about the research areas of your professors?
Also, could you please send me an application for admission to your
Ph.D. program and any other pertinent information? <P>

My adress is: <P>

        Jen Mankoff<BR>
        64 N. Park <BR>
        Oberlin, OH 44074 <P>

Thanks! <P>

               Sincerely, <P>
