<H2>Where to find information about specific schools</H2>

<A
HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/People/anwar/CS-departments.html">
A list of CS Department Home Pages around the World</A> Also remember
that most schools have names you can guess ... ie if you want to find
U of Mich, try http://www.cs.umich.edu/ or something similar. In
addition, you can <A HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/bngusenet/soc/college/top.html">send email</A> to any school and ask
them to send you a brochure. They won't charge you :). I also have
some <A HREF="tips.html">tips about sending email to gradschools</A>.
I also have some stuff (brochures, etc) that's distributed online by
some of these <A HREF="my-cs-departments.html">schools</A>. 

<H2> For those of you with specific are interests, here's some links that might help:</H2> 
<UL>
<LI>The <A HREF="ftp://archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:/pub/hci/Education/README.html">HCI Education Survey</A> has a list of schools with programs in Human Computer Interaction. You might also want to check out the <A HREF="http://www.acm.org/sigchi/chi95/homepage.html">CHI '95 Home Page</A>
<LI>If you're interested in it, there's a page full of info on <A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mleone/web/language/projects.html">Programming Language and Compiler Research
Groups</A>
<LI>If you heard something in a class that sounded interesting, and you want to find out more about it, try <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/cstr/search">searching for technical reports</a> on that subject.
<LI> In case you've forgotten, there's always the library. We have a decent selection of CS books in Mudd :).

<H2>What to do if you have no clue what you want to study or where</H2>

For those of you with no idea what you want to do, I suggest looking
around at random schools. Read about their research projects, and see
if any of them interest you. If a project interests you, download a
paper about it and read that. Then go look for other projects that
might be similar or in the same area at other schools. The schools
which have lots of interesting projects are the ones you want to apply
to :).  <P>

You might also try going to the <A
HREF="http://info.acm.org/conferences/computing_week/cw95.html">ACM
Computing Week conference.</A> In person. At that conference, you'll
have a chance to hear people talk about their research in many
different areas. In person. And see how excited they are about what
they're doing. <P>

If you're really unsure about what you want to do, remember that grad
school is not your only option. In fact, if you're <EM>not</EM>
absolutely sure that you want to spend another 2 (masters) or 6 (phd)
years in school, you want to think very carefully about whether grad
school is right for you. 

<H2>How to rate schools</H2>

It's generally a bad idea to just look at a survey-based ranking of
schools in order to determine whether or not a certain school will fit
your needs. On the other hand, a ranking might be able to help you get
a feel for whether or not you're applying to some schools which are
easy to get into and some which aren't. The best thing to do is to ask
some faculty for help judging this, but there's as a web site with a
<A HREF="http://cra.org/cgi-bin/RankCS" ADD_DATE="811618771"
LAST_VISIT="812243229">Ranking</A> of PhD Programs in Computer
Science.
