Laboratories, and Naomi Nishimura, University of Waterloo. <P>

One of the hardest things for everybody I've talked to is making the
connections, going up to people, getting to know people.  You've all
been hearing over and over again how important that is, how those
letters you get are absolutely critical. There aren't very many people
who can get good letters without making personal contacts.  This
session is coming right before lunch and I hope everyone will take it
as an assignment at lunch to try to put some of the advice that they
are getting in this panel into practice. <P>


<DT> <B>Judy Goldsmith</B>
<DD> 

I know it's bad pedagogy to give a talk sitting down, but I don't want
to deal with those stairs again.  [She was on crutches.] I'm Judy
Goldsmith, and I'm currently an assistant professor, tenure track, at
the University of Manitoba.  Next year I will be an assistant
professor, tenure track, at the University of Kentucky.  I know we are
not supposed to be talking about having a real life, but I want to say
that I am going there because my partner and I will both be tenure
tracked next year. <P>

I want to talk a little bit about making connections: how you make
connections, why you should make connections, and how to make them
work, and then pass it on to Joan Feigenbaum and Naomi Nishimura, who
will probably say the same things from different perspectives. <P>

<DL>
<DT> Why do you want to talk to people at conferences? 
<DD> Why do you want to get known?  People have been very clear on the
other panels on the benefits of being known.  You tend to get your
papers accepted if your work is known; you tend to have a slightly
better chance of getting grants if your work is known; you are more
liable to get invited to give talks if your work is known.  And we've
heard numerous people say why giving colloquium talks is good. <P>

<DT> How do you go about getting known?
<DD> One of the best ways to do it is, at conferences, just walk up to
people and start talking to them.  Introduce yourself, start a
conversation, listen to them talk about their work.  If they are
interested, if they ask, talk about your own work. <P>

<DT> To whom do you talk?
<DD> Well if you are standing around waiting in line for lunch, talk to the
people next to you.  If you see somebody in the evening standing
around the lobby of the hotel looking hungry, you can go up to them
and say, "Do you have dinner plans?"  You can also prepare ahead of
time by getting lists of the conference program and saying, "I'm
interested in this paper, I want to talk to this person.  This person
is important in my field.  I want to make sure he or she knows who I
am."  So you can do your homework ahead of time by figuring out who is
important in your field whom you want to meet, who is giving talks
that interest you.  They may or may not be the big people in your
field, they may be graduate students.  That's fine, graduate students
are important too.  Anybody you meet and you talk to, you can
introduce to someone else, and they can introduce people to you.  One
of the things that can be important if you are feeling shy and you
don't know a whole lot of people is to make a deal with somebody.
"I'll meet two people tomorrow and I'll introduce you to both of them
if you do the same for me."  It is a little thing, but little bit by
little bit it adds up. <P>

Another thing you should do to prepare for a conference if you can ---
and I never manage this --- is get some sleep the week before. <P>


<DT> Why do you want to talk to people at a conference?  
<DD> Not only might it help you get recognition, or a job, or tenure,
sometimes when you having a technical conversation with somebody, you
get a new idea.  And every so often that snap of "OH YES, I could look
at it this way," really happens, and for me it happens a lot at
conferences. <P>


<DT> How do you start a conversation?  
<DD> Besides "are you hungry," or, "do you have plans for dinner?"  You can
go up to a speaker and you can say "I liked your talk, I had a
question."  You can go up to somebody whose paper you read and say "I
really enjoyed your paper.  I was wondering why you did this."  Or you
can turn to to the person sitting next to you after a talk and say,
"did you understand that?" -- Laughter -- I've met a lot of people
that way, and furthermore, I've actually understood talks by turning
to somebody who looks like they did understand and saying, "can you
explain that to me?" <P>


<DT> Dealing with harassment:
<DD> One of the problems, one of the insecurities I have about walking up
to strange men and introducing myself is that every once in a long
while one of them is weird.  ---Laughter--- I've had good luck at
conferences.  I like almost all of the men I work with. I've met one
or two that were inappropriate.  The first time this happened to me at
a conference, I was a graduate student and I was kind of flattered and
kind of disgusted and I said "you know that's really very sweet,
but..." and he kept making the same offer all weekend, all week. <P>

The first thing to do when somebody makes an inappropriate suggestion
is say "no."  It's not up to you to protect his feelings or her
feelings.  Statistically it will be a him.--Laughter, laughter,
laughter--- It's not your responsibility to make him feel good.  He is
not complimenting you.  A sexual offer, a proposition, is simply
inappropriate and it's an insult [in this context --JG].  It might be
somebody important in your field, but that has not been my experience.
My experience of harassment has been from people who aren't really
there for the conference.  So say "no" firmly, say "no" politely; if
he continues, the simplest thing is to embarrass him.  Say, in a voice
that will carry at least three people beyond, preferably a little bit
further, "NO, I DO NOT WANT TO GO BACK TO YOUR ROOM TO LOOK AT YOUR
THEOREMS OR ANYTHING ELSE OF YOURS." --LAUGHTER--LAUGHTER--LAUGHTER--.
This is a trick I learned when I was 12 years old in New York City,
for dealing with people who harass you on the subway.  You just
embarrass them and they go away.  You haven't done anything that they
can criticize except raise your voice a bit.  You can say, "well, I
was agitated."  It's much better not to make enemies.  With high
probability it won't happen. <P>


<DT> Following up on conversations:
<DD> Once you talk to people, you can follow up on your conversation.  We
all have each other's names and addresses; most conferences do that.
It's very easy when you meet somebody, to go back to your room that
evening and make a little mark on your address list to follow up and
send this person e-mail. If they ask you a technical question, and you
don't know the answer, write to them and say, "I like that question,
it's made me think and here's a possible answer," or, "Here's a step
in the right direction.  Do you want to work on it together?"  If you
write a paper that is related to something you talked about, send them
the paper.  If you really liked talking to them, you thought they
presented an idea well, try to get them invited to a colloquium talk.
Follow up.  Keep the contacts up.  It's not just a matter of talking
for five minutes at a time, for instance.  It's a matter of building
ongoing relationships that'll last your professional life.  And they
do.  And it makes the conferences more fun because you know people and
you can continue conversations. <P>
</DL>

I have one more point and then I can pass the microphone on.  I put in
the sentence at the bottom of the blurb on making connections,
something about the "young girls' network."  A lot of people seemed
not to like that phrase.  So I want to explain that I don't mean that
we're young girls, I mean that there's a women's network that is
young.  Our network has not been around very long, has not been
effective for very long, but it is effective.  I've gotten at least
one of the jobs I've had through it.  I've gotten grants through it by
women knowing my work.  I'm here on this platform because of women who
know me and my work, and it works.  The way you work it is by
mentoring.  When you need to know something, you can ask one of the
women here who seems to know a little bit about that area. <P>

If you are interested in a job at a place where one of us is, you can
send us e-mail and say "Do you know anything?" We may or may not help
but you can at least ask.  And if you see an application, a job
application, in your institution from a woman, you can follow it up,
at least make sure that people read the folder because not all folders
get read.  You can make sure that women whom you hear give good talks
get invited for colloquia.  You can call women and say, "Hi, I'm going
to be in the area, I'd like to give a talk." And the most important
thing, the simplest thing when you hear a woman or meet a woman who
impresses you, tell other people about her.  Talk us up.  And that's
very simple.  You go back to your institution, you met somebody you
didn't know before and you say, "I met this really neat person in your
field and she was telling me about this really interesting work," and
that's a little increment to that other person.  Those little
increments add up fast. <P>


<DT> <B>Joan Feigenbaum</B>
<DD> 


I'm Joan Feigenbaum.  I'm with Bell Laboratories -- so I actually have
one of those rare basic research jobs in industry that Jill Mesirov
mentioned.  I'm a theoretical computer scientist, and I work on
complexity theory and the theory of cryptology; in the past I've
worked on graph algorithms as well.  I've been at Bell Laboratories
since I got my Ph.D. from Stanford in 1986. <P>

I actually have some very concrete suggestions on how to make
connections, and in fact I have two of them that you can act on today
or a week from today depending on when you get home and on what you're
doing tonight.  I'm part of the theoretical computer science
community, and the SIGACT bigwigs have asked me to invite you to the
STOC reception, which is going to take place tonight.  The other
immediate action item is the database that has been compiled by the
Computing Research Association Committee on the Status of Women.  The
database consists of women in computer science who are either
currently Ph.D. students or have Ph.D.s in computer science or
computer engineering.  I'm on the CRA Committee, and I'm in charge of
the database project.  The database is actually starting to be used by
journal editors, by program chairs, by potential employers, and by
lots of people who should have your names.  You're not required to be
in it if you don't want to.  If you are qualified to be in but you're
not yet in, you can get in by filling out one of these forms and
sending it to the address on the form or by contacting me
electronically.  Now if you are in the database -- that is, if you
have filled out a form and sent it to me or to the CRA in the past --
you should recently have received a copy of your record to proofread,
update and send back.  If you have not received this copy of your
record, you should get in touch with me electronically.  Don't fill
out another form, because that would result in duplicates. <P>

Those are two immediate short-term things you can do.  What are some
things you can do regularly?  As others have said, it's very important
to go to conferences -- not to go to all of the talks but rather to go
to the talks of the people whose work interests you.  These might be
famous people, and they might not.  Introduce yourselves to these
people, and talk to them about their work.  You should have a short
summary of your own work prepared so that you can say something if
they ask you what you work on, but don't take that question to mean
that you're supposed to go into a long lecture on what you work on.
Just say very briefly what you do.  If they ask detailed questions,
then you can tell them details; but most of them really want to talk
about what they do, so make sure that you ask them technical questions
about that. <P>

You can go to small conferences and workshops as well as large
conferences.  If you're having trouble getting your papers accepted to
large, prestigious conferences, it helps to publish in smaller, less
prestigious conferences and workshops first.  I know this both from my
own experience and from watching the evolution of various people's
careers.  Giving talks at small conferences and workshops will help,
because there will be some influential people who will hear these
talks.  After some influential people are familiar with your work, you
might have better luck getting things accepted to large, prestigious
conferences. <P>

For those of you who are in theoretical computer science, DIMACS
workshops are extremely useful, both for meeting people and for
publicizing your work.  Some of them are not competitive -- talks are
scheduled more or less on a first-come, first-serve basis.  So you
should be on the DIMACS mailing list.  You should find out who is
organizing which workshops.  When you see an announcement of a
workshop that you want to attend, contact the organizer of that
workshop and tell him that you want to attend and give a talk.  That
usually works.  In general, look for appropriate forums in which to
publicize your work, and don't be shy about volunteering to speak at
those forums. <P>

Tell your adviser that he's supposed to introduce you to people.  I
know it's shocking that there are advisers who don't know that they're
supposed to introduce you to people, but believe me there are advisers
who don't know anything. <P>

My next suggestion is something I have heard conflicting opinions
about, but in my experience it's a good thing to do.  Circulate
preprints of your papers to people that you think would be interested
in them, including well-known people in your field.  When I say this,
I get a lot of crinkled noses and people thinking "Oh, who wants a
flood of crappy papers from people I've never heard of?"  But, in
fact, I've always circulated preprints of what I've done.  Exactly
once in the past seven years, somebody told me, "Take me off this
mailing list."  And dozens of times, literally dozens, people said,
"Thank you very much for sending me this.  I'm really interested in
this stuff."  So I think that constitutes pretty good evidence that
circulating preprints is a good idea.  Personally, I would not ignore
a good paper that was sent to me unsolicited.  You should be aware
that some people will ignore your preprints, but I don't think you
will make enemies by circulating them, and you might create a
community of interest for your work. <P>

Give credit to people who give you good ideas!  Right now I'll take
some time to say that I discussed this question of how to make
connections with a bunch of people, including my colleagues.  David
Johnson, Peter Shor, David Applegate, and Richard Beigel all gave me
very good suggestions.  In fact, the suggestion I'm about to tell you
is something David Johnson told me, and I think it's controversial. <P>

Johnson's suggestion is "If you're just getting started doing
research, for example if you're still in grad school, one thing you
might want to do is introduce yourself to a well-known editor in your
field and volunteer to be a referee."  Now of course he is an editor
of several journals, and I'm sure he's hoping that at the STOC
reception tonight, fifty of you will tell him that you're willing to
be referees.  I'm also a journal editor, and I would like to hear from
those of you who want to be referees.  I'm sitting here looking at
Maria, who's also a journal editor, and I can see she thinks this is
the best idea she's heard all day!  Nevertheless, I think this is
controversial, and I had a strange reaction to the idea when Johnson
first suggested it.  That's because I don't know how wise it is for
someone just getting established to spend a lot of time refereeing.  I
think your primary responsibility is to publish your own work.  But, I
agree with him that a limited amount of refereeing can be to your
advantage; for example, if you introduce yourself to me and tell me
that you are willing to referee papers for the Journal of Algorithms,
I am much more likely to remember you than if you tell me "that's a
nice dress."  I'd like to generalize Johnson's suggestion and say that
you are much more likely to be remembered by famous people you meet if
you volunteer to do something that they need to get people to do!  The
general principle you should observe about refereeing and other
"service" activities is that the reward you will get should justify
the amount of time you spend.  Making a good impression on a senior
editor in your field can be a significant reward.  I think that one of
the reasons that I am an editor now is that the people who appointed
me knew that I had done a responsible job on various things that I had
done for them in the past. <P>

You can ask to be on program committees.  The first time I was on a
program committee was three years after I graduated, and I asked to be
on it.  Once you've been on one, you tend to be on many.  The first
time, I asked the program chair directly whether he would put me on
the committee, and it turns out that he did.  If that's not possible,
you could let the SIG president or someone else who's very influential
in the community know that you're interested in being on program
committees -- or that you're interested in doing whatever it is you're
interested in.  Some people think that this practice of volunteering,
especially when what you're volunteering for is coveted, is taken
wrong or is perceived as impolite or pushy.  I think it's not such a
big deal.  It's really done a lot more often by a lot more people than
you realize. <P>

Next I have another suggestion by David Johnson.  You should know what
the important people in your field look like.  If you don't know what
they look like, you may miss an opportunity to meet one of them.
Johnson told me that this actually happened to him -- in the dark ages
when he was just starting out.  He didn't know what people looked
like, and he wound up chatting with someone about the movies or
something and later realized that this was someone he should have been
introducing himself to.  I guess it worked out okay for him.  What's
ironic is that I was at a DIMACS workshop recently where he was
chatting about the movies with a graduate student who is working on
something directly related to his previous work, and this grad student
didn't know who he was.  So, this really happens all the time.  The
moral is that you should know what the important people in your field
look like not so that you can bask in their presence but so that you
can take an opportunity to introduce yourself if you have a technical
thing to say. <P>

I think that's it as far as specifics suggestions are concerned.  I'll
take questions. <P>


<DT> <B>Naomi Nishimura
</B>
<DD> 

I'm going to take a slightly different slant on things.  Since the
opposite of being well connected is feeling isolated, you could view
this discussion as being not only about making connections and
research contacts but also about avoiding the feeling of isolation.  A
conference is a very obvious place to try to start making connections,
but it's also a very easy place to feel isolated, to feel that you
don't belong.  So I'll start talking about conferences but I'd also
like to talk about how you might make connections outside of
conferences. <P>

<DL>
<DT> Whom should you meet at conferences?  
<DD> 

Don't ignore the people who aren't famous.  I think a lot of us have
had the experience of someone talking to you and looking over your
shoulder for somebody more important to talk to.  Getting snubbed.
The lowly graduate students of today could be the superstars of
tomorrow.  Don't ignore them.  I don't suggest that when you meet
somebody, you try to assess what their future will be like and then
decide how many minutes to spend talking to them.  Go ahead and talk
to them in any case. <P>


<DT> Why should you meet them?  
<DD> 

The people who are your peers are the people who will form your
research community in the future.  They might not seem important now,
but you'll be with them for a long time.  It's also an easier sort of
contact to make, at least for me.  I feel pretty shy going up to
important people but I feel much more at ease talking to people at my
level, and there are also more natural topics of conversation that
will come up.  You're at the same stage; you're going through the same
sorts of experiences.  Talking to women might be one of the ways in
which you can make this easier; talking to women might be easier for
you. <P>

Now, I've talked about getting research contacts and said you should
talk to graduate students because they might be superstars in the
future.  But, even if they're not in your research area, it's
important to have the social connections.  Those are valuable as well.
You never know what your research might be in the future or what their
research might be in the future; there might be overlaps.  And even if
there never is an overlap, if you make the social connection, then
you're part of that person's research-and-social circle, and then can
meet other people in that circle.  Those people in turn might become
research contacts.  And even if you don't make any research contacts
through that social connection, there's still a person whom you like
to talk to at conferences, making conferences seem like a happier,
more welcoming place to be, and that's important.  You're going to be
happier.  It will feel more worthwhile to go to conferences. <P>


<DT> Where do you meet them?
<DD> 

Joan already mentioned that you don't only have to go to big
conferences and I think that's important, not only because it might be
easier to get papers in [to smaller conferences --JG], but because you
might feel more relaxed there.  There might be fewer people, the
conference might be on for a longer time; there may be more
opportunities to make the contacts.  If you're a graduate student you
might consider looking for conferences that are graduate student
operated and organized, and for which all speakers are graduate
students.  There's one of this sort that is run in Buffalo.  There
might be retreats or local seminars of that sort.  There are summer
schools, NSF workshops, where you can meet a smaller number of people
over a longer period of time.  Or consider doing research during the
summer in some location other than your institution.  That's another
good way to meet people. <P>


<DT> How do you meet them?  
<DD> 

Well, I'm kind of tongue-tied and I'm not good at going up and asking
people whether they have dinner plans or that kind of thing.  Assume
that a first stage as Joan mentioned was to have your advisor
introduce you.  That eases things a little bit.  Another natural
starting point is to meet with graduates of the institution you went
to and start meeting people through them.  Now this all assumes that
you have an advisor who's already well connected.  It also assumes
that you go to a big enough school that there are lots of graduates
out there.  That's not necessarily the case.  What can you do then? <P>

There are social events at a conference as has been mentioned.  Lunch
can be particularly good, since you're sitting in one spot.  You don't
have to worry about people looking over their salads for somebody more
important to talk to.  They're stuck with you for the duration of the
lunch.  But be a little bit careful.  I know that if you want to go to
a lunch and get involved in a technical discussion because you want to
make research contacts, the worst thing to do is to sit next to people
who are having a technical discussion, because they're probably
working on a paper for a deadline.  They don't want to talk to you.
They're just talking to each other.  They'll probably ignore you and
that's a wasted opportunity; there could have been other people
sitting there whom you could have actually met.  So, I think it's
better to go to a lunch table where people are talking socially.  One
other aspect that probably isn't brought up that much: another good
way of meeting people is to help other people meet people.  The few
people that you know, you introduce to each other.  You may know
people who have either social or research reasons that they might get
along.  Make an effort to do that. <P>

Conferences of course might be too expensive or too rare to be the
only way to rely on to make contacts.  So what can you do if you're
not at a conference?  If you are reading a paper and you have
questions about the paper you can, through the anonymity of e-mail,
not feel quite as embarrassed about asking questions about the paper.
It's also a good way of paving the way to actually meeting the person
in person if you have a chance in the future.  It can make you feel
more comfortable about that.  You can meet visitors to your
department, seminar speakers, post-docs, people who are on sabbatical,
students of people on sabbatical and then try to keep in touch with
them afterwards.  If they're people you'd like to meet and you don't
feel comfortable going up to them at conferences, if they're people
who are looking over your head, you might consider suggesting that
they come as speakers.  If you're a graduate student and don't have
the power to organize a colloquium yourself, see if you can ask the
colloquium organizer or your advisor to make that sort of suggestion.
You can try to stay in touch with people electronically or even
introduce people to each other electronically.  It's another option. <P>
</DL>

I'd like to end with advice that has worked very well for me and this
is something that's very local and it doesn't sound like it has direct
benefits but  builds slowly.  When I was a graduate student I met
every month with a group of women graduate students in computer
science and electrical engineering. We talked about all sorts of
things.  It made us all feel a little bit more comfortable about being
in graduate school because we had a community of like-minded people.
We could speak openly, we felt.  These people of course -- we didn't
think about it at the time -- but these people have graduated
and have gone to other institutions and have started forming a network
of their own.  We've learned from each other's experiences about
interviews, about writing grants, about all the steps along the way.
And it wasn't something which we ever intended, which is the beauty of
it.  It was just something that we wanted to do, made us feel
comfortable and now has grown and blossomed into more of a set of
connections.  So, the last point I want to make is, don't expect the
connections to come overnight.  They come slowly and but those are the
strongest and most beautiful ones.  Don't give up.  Thanks. <P>


<DT> <B>Goldsmith</B>
<DD> 

Shall we take a little time for questions?  Okay.  So we've told you
how to start a conversation with the person next to you and how to get
onto a program committee, and a few things in between, and now we'll
take questions.  We'll try to answer really briefly so we can get a
couple of questions, if people have them, and then get to lunch where
we can practice. <P>


<DT> <B>Question</B>
<DD> 

I have a question. What are the criteria for being on a program
committee?  There must be some.  There must be something that's a
qualification for being on it other than just you're interested. <P>


<DT> <B>Feigenbaum</B>
<DD> 


I think that the official criteria for being on a program committee
are exactly what you would expect: You're supposed to be a well-known
researcher in the field or an up-and-coming researcher in the field.
Now by and large that's true.  It's rare that people who are not
themselves widely published are put on program committees.  It's not
unheard of, but it's rare.  However, it's not the case that everyone
who does publish a lot winds up being on program committees.  That was
why I suggested letting it be known that you want to be on program
committees, because there are very qualified people who are passed
over.  Not for any nefarious reasons.  They're just passed over
because nobody happens to think of them at the right time.  If you
make it well known that you're interested in doing this, I think it
increases the chances that somebody will think of you when making up a
program committee.  As far as other criteria are concerned, one thing
I've heard program chairs say is that they want to have people who are
well connected.  They usually say they want them at well known places
where there are a lot of other people.  This is because they expect
program committee members to ask their colleagues for input on the
submissions.  This might be unique to my community, and perhaps in
other communities it's sort of frowned on for committee members to ask
other people's opinions.  In any case, I think the only thing you can
do to increase your chances, aside from publishing your own papers, is
to let it be known that you want to do it. <P>

And go to the conference!  It's a little thing, but conference
committees do prefer to have program committees made up of people who
attend the conference.  There's one conference that the three of us
(Judy, Joan, and Naomi) share some interest in -- the Structure in
Complexity Theory Conference.  I was just on the program committee for
Structures '93, and I know that the Structures steering committee is
loathe to ask someone to be on the program committee who has not
attended the conference, even if the person's research makes him an
excellent choice. <P>


<DT> <B>Question</B>
<DD> 


Alright.  I have a question about preprints and sending out preprints
to people.  What do you do if you're going to cite something in the
paper, in the preprint, when it hasn't been published yet and how do
you deal with that? <P>


<DT> <B>Feigenbaum</B>
<DD> 

O.K. The best way, I think, to deal with that is to make the
preliminary version into a technical report so that it can be cited. <P>


<DT> <B>Question</B>
<DD> 

You wait until you have the technical report before you...? <P>


<DT> <B>Feigenbaum</B>
<DD> 

I was assuming that making something into a technical report was an
instantaneous process.  If you're in a situation in which you have to
wait before something comes out as a technical report, then I would
say first try to change that procedure at your university, because
technical reports should be a time-stamping mechanism -- if there's a
long delay, that's not good.  But I think it's perfectly ok to use the
citation format "author, title, `Manuscript,' date."  I've done that,
and I've had my own preprints cited that way.  If what you're worried
about is that people might take your ideas and not cite them, ... well
I don't think you should send your preprints to those people.  But you
can make people in general understand that, if they want to cite your
ideas, that's okay, but that they have to at least say that these
ideas came from your manuscript and include the manuscript date in the
citation. <P>


<DT> <B>Question</B>
<DD> 

I have a question about the use of business cards.  I have business
cards and I just had a lengthy discussion with a recent graduate on
whether she should put Dr. or Ph.D.  Yet I've been to several
conferences over the last couple of years, big and small conferences,
and I have never seen the distribution of a business card.  Therefore
I was not comfortable with that.  I just wonder about your comments on
the use of these things. <P>


<DT> <B>Feigenbaum</B>
<DD> 

I've rarely seen the exchange of business cards.  I've seen it at the
Crypto Conference where there are a lot of government and industry
people.  I think it's rare among academics, at least when they're
talking to each other.  On the other hand, I don't think it hurts to
have business cards.  It can be a convenient way to give your phone
number to someone. <P>


<DT> <B>Goldsmith</B>
<DD> 

It's very good when you want to go up to someone who gave a talk and
you want to ask them to send you a paper or something... you can hand
them a card. <P>


<DT> <B>Various audience members</B>
<DD> 

Uh-huh. Yeah and you can write on.... <P>

I do think you need business cards if you're dealing with industry at all. <P>

I just wanted to say I go through scads of business cards.  I never
admitted it before. ..... <P>


<DT> <B>Feigenbaum</B>
<DD> 

I guess that's one more way in which my job is not "real industry."
I have a zillion business cards that I've never used for anything. <P>


<DT> <B>Question</B>
<DD> 

I have a remark about the difficulty of making connections at
conferences.  I find that in big conferences like this FCRC, it's just
really awkward to talk about your scientific work, having dinner with
people you don't know or asking people questions after you've listened
to their talk for twenty minutes and you barely have understood what
the problem is.  I mean it's very hard to come up with interesting
discussions.  And then even social talk is really unsatisfactory.
After three days you're really tired of it and you feel you don't get
anything out of it so I find that when I go to a big conference what I
like is meeting the people I know.  And the way I meet new people is
to go to small workshops where the talks are for one hour so after the
talk if I'm interested I have enough of a basis for an interesting
discussion and the people are closer to my field.  Often we do things,
since we are just a small workshop with 30 or 50 people, like hike
together or do some other activities, which make it easier to know
people on a more informal, natural basis. <P>


<DT> <B>Mary Vernon</B>
<DD> 

I was program chair for the 1990 ACM SIGmetrics Conference.  From the
perspective of program chairs and how they choose committees, I just
wanted to say that I think it is fine if you speak up in certain ways
that you'd be interested in being on a program committee, but I think
one thing to recognize about the process is that the program chair is
the one who takes responsibility for choosing the committee, and is
going to try to choose the committee based on a whole lot of criteria.
The way I think is the most effective to speak up is to talk to
somebody who knows your work well and who thinks very highly of your
work and who, at the appropriate time, suggests you as a very capable
person and who'll leave it at that and let the process take care of
itself.  There are lots and lots of very good assistant professors who
don't get on committees until after they've been at the business for
several years, so I don't think it's something you need to feel that
you have to achieve with the first couple of years or two or three
years as an assistant professor.  It's really good to recognize what
the process is about and the responsibility that the chair takes and
all of the different criteria the chair tries to take into account in
choosing the balance of the committee.  So it's just I think pressure
can come in the wrong way and can hurt you if you aren't aware of that
whole issue. <P>


<DT> <B>Feigenbaum</B>
<DD> 

Yeah, okay.  I wasn't suggesting high-pressure.  I think Mary is very right. <P>


<DT> <B>Vernon</B>
<DD> 

I know that Joan and I are in violent agreement on this. <P>


<DT> <B>Feigenbaum</B>
<DD> 

I think that Mary is very right, and I'm glad that she mentioned that
it's good to have an intermediary put your name forward.  Instead of
talking directly to the program chair, you might go through a senior
person who knows your work well, or you might go through the SIG
president or somebody who's regularly asked to suggest names.  I guess
I should make clear that I'm not suggesting that you nag people or
that you put pressure on people -- just a very clear, simple statement
to the effect that you're interested in serving will suffice. <P>


<DT> <B>Joann Ordille</B>
<DD> 

I'm Joann Ordille from University of Wisconsin.  I just wanted to
share some advice I got on how to meet people at conferences.  And the
advice was to ask people you run into who is working on the thing that
you're now most interested in, and remember their name.  And then when
you meet that person, you say, "Oh so-and-so said that you're working
on this." And normally that's enough to get them to tell you all about
what they're currently working on and that's what you're interested in
too. Then it's pretty natural to start up a conversation.  And this
worked really well for me when I couldn't quite make connections. <P>


<DT> <B>Ruth Silverman</B>
<DD> 

Hello.  I'm Ruth Silverman from University of the District of
Columbia.  I just wanted to mention that Ian Parberry said at a STOC
meeting or FOCS meeting, I've forgotten which, a couple of years ago,
that if you had three papers accepted and you haven't refereed one
you're not doing your part of your obligation to the community.  So,
if you look at it that way, that by putting yourself forward you are
fulfilling your obligation rather than being pushy, it might affect
your outlook. <P>


<DT> <B>Maria Klawe</B>
<DD> 

Well I just wanted to tell you about my first experience attending a
conference.  It was the AMS Annual Meetings.  It was in St. Louis.  It
was, I think, in 1976. <P>


<DT> <B>Feigenbaum</B>
<DD> 

You should tell people what "AMS" is. <P>


<DT> <B>Klawe</B>
<DD> 

This is the American Math Society and this is a humungous meeting.
There are maybe two or three thousand people there and I went to a
special session on the geometry of Banach spaces which was an area I
was very interested in, and this was going to run all day for two days
in a row.  The format was that each speaker spoke for twenty minutes
and then there was a ten-minute gap while people could move around and
then the next talk started for twenty minutes.  There were probably
about a hundred or a hundred and fifty people in the room and I didn't
know a single person.  I did know a lot of the names because I'd been
taking a graduate special topics course in this area and I actually,
frankly, was quite amazed to see what some of the people looked like,
having heard their names.  I think I was the only woman in the room
most of the time.  Sometimes there was one other woman there.  My
experience with the first day was that I sat and I listened to the
twenty minutes of talks and I was really excited.  And then I squirmed
for ten minutes while everybody else got up and talked to their
friends and I thought everybody's looking at her and she doesn't know
anybody.  And I didn't. I went home and I didn't have anyone to go out
for dinner with that evening and I went back to the hotel and I said
I'm never going to go to another conference in my life.  This is
terrible.  I'm really humiliated by this experience.  But I did go
back the next day and do you know it was amazing.  Person after person
came up to me and asked who I was.  I mean they had been watching me
sitting there all by myself and wondering who is this woman?  Where
did she come from?  Is she interested in the geometry of Banach
spaces?  And I got to meet all the big names and all the big stars and
they introduced me to each other.  Now if I'd given up after the first
day, which really was truly horrible, it would have been a pity.  So,
my advice is, sometimes the way you see what's happening is really
different from what's really happening and if you just sort of stick
with it, it gets a lot better. <P>


<DT> <B>Brown</B>

Is there one more question?  Or anecdote? <P>

Okay.  Well thank you, panel. --APPLAUSE-- <P>
