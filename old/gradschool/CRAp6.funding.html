Well thanks very much to the panel. Our next session is on a topic
that, as you've heard earlier today, is very important in terms of the
tenure process and that is getting funding. And I think of all the
things that a person has to do as an academic, this is the one that's
the most like a game with strange rules, that if you know the rules
you're way ahead. So, this panel is going to help you understand what
some of those strange rules are.   <P>


<DT> <B>Susan Eggers</B>
<DD> 

It's great to see so many of you here today. It really gives us, the
presenters, a shot in the arm. <P>

We're going to try to tell you a few things about how to raise money.
Our talks should all have a practical bent.  The we is, I'm Susan
Eggars from the University of Washington and to my right are Marina
Chen from Yale University and Helen Gigley, who is now at the Naval
Research Labs, but formerly worked at the National Science Foundation. <P>

And this is what we're going to talk about: we're going to cover
several points in the grant submission process.  (1) One of the most
important is the submission strategy; basically, the networking that
is necessary to get your foot in the door, what you have to do before
you ever write a word.  (2) Then we're going to spend some time on
what a good proposal (we have no interest in bad proposals), what a
good proposal looks like.  (3) Then what to do when your proposal is
rejected; how to turn that into a learning experience.  Because, in
fact, your proposals will get rejected. Ours do. All the time. Every
year.  We want to show you how to turn that experience around, so that
you submitt a successful proposal the next time.  (4) A lot of the
information in these topics pertains to all funding sources:
peer-reviewed federal agencies, government-reviewed federal agencies,
industry, technical consortia and university grants and so forth.  We
also have some comments about the separate sources of funding, because
they do have some different requirements.  (5) And then we're going to
cover many of the points I've already mentioned, but from the point of
view of someone who has been on the other side, not submitting
proposals, but accepting them. <P>

So, first, the submission strategy.  Often people want to know whether
you should submit one proposal or several.  My personal opinion is the
latter: that you should diversify; and there are two reasons why.  The
first is that not all funding sources fund everything you will need.
Industry tends to give equipment, and the federal government tends to
support salaries.  The second reason is that you won't get all your
proposals funded.  So it's a good idea to cover your bets. <P>

A good model is to write what I will call a core technical proposal, a
core technical text on which you can base several proposals, each of
which is sent to a different source.  Here are some examples.  You
send the very same proposal to both the National Science Foundation
(whom you ask for RA salaries and your summer salary) and to Sun
Microsystems (whom ask for workstations).  It's the same work, but
you're asking for different types of support.  As another example, in
the core proposal you might have different subprojects, each doing a
separate part of the work, perhaps each with a different focus.  You
could submit some of the subprojects to the National Science
Foundation and then different ones to ONR.  And why do you want to do
that?  It saves time.  If we take for given that you want to submit
several proposals, it saves you time to submit variations of the same
one than craft several new proposals from scratch.  (Frankly, in the
beginning of your career you might not have that many research
ideas...!)  The only time I have sent identical proposals to different
federal agencies, I told them I was doing so. They said that they
didn't mind.  And why? Because if they both had liked the proposal,
they would have funded it jointly, saving themselves some money, and
getting credit for the research.  Looking at it from the funders'
point of view, they want to get good researchers in their programs,
i.e., they want to be funding viable research.  So if they can share
funding with another agency, they generally like to do that. <P>

Then there's the question of whether you should be the sole principal
investigator on a grant or collaborate with others; and the answer is
yes.  There are some agencies that have sources of funding strictly
for one PI, such as the RIA, Research Initiation Award.  That's the
one you'll probably submit to first; it's for young faculty who have
never been a PI on any other research proposal.  Other NSF funds are
being channeled in the direction of collaborative research, for
example, the Grand Challenge funding, for which they want you to
collaborate with researchers in the applications areas.  So the answer
is you should do both, empahsizing the approach that makes most sense
for you, taking into account how far along you are in academia and how
broad your research interests are. <P>

Another key piece of advise is to start the proposal-writing process
early.  And what do I mean by early?  I mean, if these proposals are
due in October or November, start gathering your thoughts in June.
One reason is that it takes a long time to focus your fuzzy, new
ideas, into a concrete, credible proposal.  It's not merely a matter
of writing things down; you're trying to motivate a problem, come up
with a good solution and explain it well.  It will take you several
iterations to get it right.  The second reason is that you're new at
this.  You're going to do it badly the first few times.  So you want
to leave yourself enough time, so that when you actually send in the
proposal, it looks good.  Remember, the competition for funding is
high. <P>

It's important to get feedback on your proposal before you send it in.
Show the proposal to someone else on your faculty, someone in your
area who has written successful proposals.  If there's no one on the
faculty in your area, you could ask someone you met while you were
interviewing, say, someone who offered you a job.  You could also ask
people you've met at conferences. <P>

Before you start writing, take a look at some successful proposals.
Pick ones in your area, so you can at least understand what they are
about, and they can serve as guides.  For example, if you do
experimental work, read a proposal in experimental work, so you can
see what kinds of things they talk about, how much space they devote
to the various sections, how they hone their arguments and so forth.
I found that very helpful.  Now you can begin to understand why you
have to start in June. <P>

The next two points are related.  The first of these is to learn which
intra-organization groups fund what type of research.  This applies
both to subagencies or directorates in the federal government and to
research groups in industry.  You want to submit your proposal to the
appropriate group.  Meaning, you want to try to find a good match
between the research you want to do and what different subgoups are
interested in funding.  Find that out ahead of time.  (At the end of
the proceedings on this session is a partial list of the federal
agencies, the names of the program directors in each agency, their
telephone numbers and e-mail addresses.)  Should you make a mistake,
particularly at NSF, your proposal will probably be routed internally
to the right directorate. <P>

Try not to submit your proposal cold. Get to know your program
director or industrial contact.  How do you get to know him? (Pardon
my sexism, but he is usually a him.)  The typical way is to meet him
at conferences.  Many program directors -- now I'm focusing on getting
federal funding -- many program directors go to conferences, primarily
because they are trying to evaluate the research being presented.  If
you do good work, they are coming to meet you as well.  You can use
that opportunity to introduce yourself.  Yes, I mean introduce
yourself -- cold.  Proposals were never granted to wallflowers.  You
walk right up to this guy and you say something like: "I'm Susan
Eggers from the University of Washington.  I'm submitting a proposal
to your agency in the fall, and I'd like to talk to you about my
work." or "I do work in X, Y, and Z areas; I'd like to talk to you
about them, to see if you are interested in funding them."  He may
say, politely, and in the best case, "Oh yes, Susan. I've read your
work." (...!)  Don't count on that one...explain to him what you do
anyway.  And he may sit down with you right then and there and talk.
Or he may say, "I'm too busy right now."  in which case you pin him
down for lunch tomorrow or after some session is over. But don't let
him get away.  If he just happens to be too busy at the conference, or
if he's giving you the runaround, don't be flapped. Take it in stride.
But get his card and tell him you'll give him a call after he gets
back to Washington.  And make sure you do that, and soon. <P>

No matter what he has responded, you will eventually find yourself in
the situation where you are explaining your research to him.  You must
get across, very concisely, very coherently and very strongly what
problem you are solving, your plan to solve it and why your approach
is so great. You don't have much time to do this. So you should plan
ahead, just like you plan for a talk.  Decide what you're going to
say, and, would you believe this, practice it before you pick up the
telephone.  Again, let me stress the main point: you have very little
time to get across what your reserach is, the idea that you are
competent and your research is good, and that he should fund it.
Don't waste his time.  And thank him when you're done.  (I must sound
like your mother.)  As I said before, the best place to do this is at
a conference, face to face. <P>

Now, why do you want to do this?  There are basically two reasons.
First, program directors often have funding agendas.  If they like the
work that you are doing, they will sometimes help you alter it a
little, so that it is more in line with what they are able to fund.
That's very helpful.  Secondly, there are lots of proposals out there
-- the funding ratio is something hideous like 1 in 5, or 1 in 8.  If
your proposal is one of many that have been given very good reviews,
the fact that you've had a personal contact with the program director
may be the tiebreaker in your favor.  Don't underestimate this.  Is
this the most important thing I'm going to tell you?  Maybe.  One of
them, anyway.  Get to know these program directors. <P>

Often federal agencies will send out requests for proposals.  They may
call them something else, but that's basically what they are.  Read
the proposal and follow it to the letter.  For example, they may ask
you for a section on how your research will further undergraduate
education.  What on earth, you think?  I devise very technical schemes
for speeding up partial evaluation.  Do it anyway.  You will be
pleasantly surprised to find that if you think about it long enough,
you will discover many, many ways in which your research does, in
fact, further undergraduate education. <P>

Lastly, submit on time.  Often proposals are funded first come, first
serve, and both federal agencies and industrial groups will run out of
money.  I would be a shame to be in the situation where you have a
really good proposal, and there is simply no money left to fund it.
So get them in on time. That's important. There are no extensions
here.  If you don't hear from a federal agency in a certain amount of
time, say, five weeks -- you usually get a slip saying that they got
your proposal and it is winding its way through the bureaucracy -- --
if you don't get one, call up the program director and ask what has
gone wrong.  He'll track it down. <P>

All the points on the next slide have to do with what I consider to be
the heart of the proposal.  This whole section contains things that
are very easy for me to say but will be very hard for you to do.  It's
very easy for me to tell you to write a concise, original, well-argued
proposal in fifteen pages, and it will be very hard for you to do
that.  Even the fifteen page part is hard. <P>

One important rule of thumb you can begin with is to have only one
research objective for your porposal.  Ask for funding for one
well-defined purpose.  For example, propose that you want to eliminate
false sharing, not all performance issues in parallel computing, just
false sharing.  When you're writing about this objective, define some
clearly achievable goals.  You can of course put in a paragraph
decribing more pie-in-the-sky goals and where they will lead to; this
will show that you're thinking ahead, thinking beyond the state of the
art, and that your problem and the approach that you plan to take are
important enough that they might make a difference with these longer
range goals.  But you want to make sure that the goals you've
discussed in your proposal, what you want the funding for, you can
actually achieve. <P>

One of the first sections in the proposal is a discussion of the
problem you plan to solve.  You should make it very clear that it is a
problem worth solving.  The best mousetrap in the world is no good if
there is no mouse.  This is important even if you're working in a
field where no one doubts that the problem is important.  For example,
some of my research involves hiding memory latencies.  No one will
dispute that it's an important issue, both in parallel and
uniprocessor computing.  I still have to say why hiding memory
latencies or eliminating memory operations is appropriate in my corner
of the parallel world.  For example, "the performance bottleneck in
low-end shared memory machines is bus traffic.  Invalidation misses
are responsible for most of the bus traffic; false-sharing misses
comprise the largest component of that."  It clearly looks like a
problem.  (Or at least they thought it did.)  To summarize, make it
very clear why the problem that you're solving is an important one to
solve. <P>

Another section of the proposal should discuss how you plan to solve
the problem.  This discussion is fairly high level, but it still takes
up most of the proposal.  What you are going to do, not the
nitty-gritty details of how you plan to do it.  For example, "my
research will identify per-process shared data and restructure that
data to eliminate false sharing.  We will identify unique per-process
control flow graphs and extend traditional summary side-effect
analysis", and then I say how I'm going to extend it.  Notice I am
only talking about what I'm going to do, not how I'm going to do it.
I don't spend time in the proposal on details of the methodology or
the experiments.  And why not?  Those are things that the reviewers
may not understand or that may give the reviewers little points they
can dispute.  And, in actual fact, these are methodological details
that will change over time as you gain more experience with this
particular research.  Why give the reviewers something they won't
completely understand or can dispute, when, in fact, it's probably
going to change. <P>

Now for the sell.  One of the most important sections of the proposal
has to sell you and your idea.  This is often hard for women to do.
Make sure that the following five points are part of your proposal.
First, show how your work is promising.  Say how right out; don't beat
around the bush.  Second, say how your work is different than,
hopefully implying better, but maybe not, maybe just different and as
also good as that of other people who are doing similar research.
("Others are transforming control in order to alter the per-process
order of memory accesses.  We will achieve the same ends by
transforming the data directly.")  An alternative would be to show how
your work complements those people.  Both are legitimate ways to
proceed.  Third, talk about how you are qualified to carry out this
work.  One way to do this is to discuss your track record, which, in
your case, means your thesis.  Another factor could be your current
computing environment.  "My department has a CM-5"; or "my colleagues
are X and Y who are experts in Z".  Any of those things can count
toward how you in your current environment are qualified to carry out
the work.  Fourth, give the funders some indication that what you are
proposing to do might actually work.  If you do experimental work, put
in some preliminary data.  (To continue with our running proposal, "we
have presented data that shows that false sharing is a performance
problem, and that applying transformations manually virtually
eliminates it.")  If you do theory, sketch out partial proofs.  If you
develop algorithms, put in some algorithmic design.  And last, discuss
how your results will be of value to the funder. <P>

In the related work section you should show that you are up on the
literature.  Don't slight other researchers, but avoid gratuitous
references.  Yes, it's a fuzzy line.  You will have probably have
covered much of the related work in other sections ofthe proposal. <P>

One last word on reviewers.  Sometimes you will have the opportunity
to recommend reviewers for your proposal.  When making suggestions,
don't leave out a whole school of thought.  And if you would rather
the funders avoided someone, say so, and why.  I have a few
suggestions to keep the reviewers happy: keep to the page limits, the
shorter, the better; don't give tutorials or make arguments from first
principles; and add bullets to summarize the research goals near the
end of the proposal. <P>

Ok, the proposal has been sent, a millenia has passed, and your
reviews have now come back.  Let's begin with the easy case, when it
has been accepted.  You should: A) Do a good job.  B) Cite the funder
in research papers or any other appropriate public forum.  And C) Keep
in touch with the program director.  Sometimes that's an automatic
part of your funding process; you may have to write an annual report.
But if that's not a requirement, call your director; and send him your
papers.  It's important to keep in touch with the program director,
because you would like him to fund you the next time as well. <P>

Now, when your proposal is rejected.  First of all, do not be
discouraged.  Everyone, absolutely everyone, has proposals rejected.
There is not enough money for this not to happen.  So the first thing
you should do is damage control on your spirits.  Just take it in
stride and keep submitting.  Second, treat the rejection as a learning
experience and use what you learn to make your next proposal that much
better.  One suggestion -- and this is probably only appropriate if
your proposal was a borderline rejection, i.e., the reviews were
pretty good reviews -- if the reviews said the proposal was a dog,
don't do this -- One suggestion is to call your program director (with
whom you are now of course best buddies) and ask why was it rejected.
No complaining, no whining -- just a simple question.  This, of
course, is something you cannot do repeatedly.  At NSF the program
directors have to write up a summary that justifies why they have
decided not to fund you.  They will sometimes read that summary to you
or at least use it to discuss with you what was wrong with your
proposal (in their minds) and what you can do to improve it.  You
should always take the reviews very seriously.  If they complain about
something, fix it.  Sometimes, the complaints result from the
reviewers misunderstanding something you have written.  This is
probably your fault.  For example, in my now famous false-sharing
proposal, I was proposing to directly restructure shared data,
something very different (at the time) from the rest of the community,
who were indirectly restructuring data by transforming control.  Every
single reviewer read the proposal with control-restructuring eyes.  It
was simply the current strategy.  Whose fault was that?  Mine!  So the
next time I submitted that proposal, I made it very clear that I was
taking an alternate tack. <P>

Let me stop here, so we can discuss differences amoung funding
sources, and see how this all works from the funders point of view. <P>


<DT> <B>Helen Gigley</B>
<DD> 


What I intended to do was to give you an overview of some different
funding perspectives from the government's side.  If there were time,
I would tell you exactly what happens to a proposal at NSF, but I
don't think we'll have time for that. <P>

You've heard two different perspectives on government funding.
There's basically military and non-military, and there are different
ways to market your research for each.  I'll cover different aspects
of funding than what has been said before, and for both. <P>

First, I'll go over the agencies, but more completely.  Then, where to
look for the announcements.  And finally, what are white papers and
what are proposals?  So that you get a sense of what the different
jargon is, and what the different kinds of proposals are. <P>

First, the funding agencies.  Some of these you've seen up here
before, some you haven't, ARPA is formerly DARPA. The reason it's now
called the Advance Research Project Agency is because they're now
looking at dual-use research. It is no longer fashionable to be doing
military research only. They have recently become the laboratory
that's spearheading this. You'll find in congressional records and in
the way the appropriation bills in Congress are going, everything's
going dual-use. So that nothing is going to be focused on just
military applications. This is your collecting up the extra military
money.  ONR (Office of Naval Research) is the navy research
organization, and ARI is the army one.  I have some more information
on some of these organizations; some I don't. ARI is located in
Alexandria, Virginia, if you want to try to track them down. ARPA is
in Arlington, Virginia and so is ONR. They're about two blocks from
each other, so that if you can come to Washington, you can visit both
institutions and even NSF in a day, easily.  The airforce (AFOSR) is
at Boeing airforce base, which is also in D.C., but you have to have a
car to get to it.  The others are accessible with public
transportation. <P>

Now, on to other agencies.  You've heard about NSF. Thre's also NIH
and NIMH.  Both fund computer science research but not very much and
in very constrained areas.  NIMH concentrates on database research.
The Department of Energy, the Department of Agriculture, just about
any agency that the federal government has, funds research.  So all
you need to do is start calling around to find out what they're
funding that you might be able to hook into.  Just call. Ask. That's
the best way to get a handle on it.  If you have a good grants office
at your university, they can put you in touch with many of these
programs, and they keep in touch with special announcements that come
out.  There's also NASA.  The Department of Commerce is another place.
That's where all the translation, a large part of the natural language
translation, is funded.  And then, of course, NSA does a lot of the
security work in coding and encryption, plus some other mathematical
and theoretical kinds of computer science. <P>

Look at the list of ARPA programs at the end of the proceedings.  If
there's not a telephone number for your area, just call the main
number.  Tell them what your research area is and ask to speak to the
appropriate program manager.  Chances are they're on travel, because
they are most of the time.  If they are, see if you can get their
e-mail address.  The e-mail extension is still DARPA.mil; often the
full address is their last name@DARPA.mil. <P>

In addition to the programs listed in the proceedings, ONR funds neuro
and cognitive science, and visualization research; here they're
looking at virtual environments and some other computer
science-related issues.  Again, call. <P>

Don't worry about calling the wrong office at NSF.  Their offices are
huge rooms; as soon as you call into one office, people can pass your
phone call wherever it needs to go. <P>

Now, on to where you can look for funding announcements.  If you want
to find out what's happening in general, you need to know about the
Commerce Business Daily.  It comes out daily, and it's about this
thick daily.  It gives absolutely everything that is being advertised
that you might want to consider as funding projects for any thing
that's going on in the government.  For the military there's something
called Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) that ONR and ARPA produce.
These are basically general statements of program areas for which
agencies are interested in having proposals.  It's not a call for a
proposal.  It basically just says, "Hey, if you're doing work in this
kind of an area, let us know about it.  We might have some money for
you."  There is no commitment of funding to any of the BAAs,
necessarily.  So, again, you're in this selling position.  I don't
know how to tell you this, but as new faculty you're probably in the
biggest marketing position in your life.  And you might think that
this is something you have no intention of doing; but let me tell you,
all you're doing is marketing your ideas, yourself, your competence,
your ability to get the work done.  You're in a selling position from
now until you get yourself established.  Anyhow, the BAAs are
basically obtained by schmoozing, calling up the program managers.  In
some cases you can't. I have some from NRL that specifically prohibit
you from contacting anybody.  You send in a two-page description of
what you want to do.  Only after someone receives the initial contact
are you allowed to call to ask whether there's funding.  So you have
to check that on the BAAs. <P>

There are also white paper requests.  (You will sometimes hear people
referring to these as Requests for Proposals or RFPs.)  A white paper
a very general description of the research you want to do.  It gives
some budget information and some idea of how many students you want to
support.  It can't be very detailed, because it's only five pages
long.  Again, what it does is introduce your ideas to the program
manager.  This time the program manager has specific money allocated
for a task and this is your way to try to get into the DARPA funding
apparatus that Marina was just talking about.  Often, you will find
these requests for papers in the Commerce Business Daily; sometimes
they come out in e-mail announcements. <P>

NSF is a very different agency.  It is the only government agency that
accepts unsolicited proposals.  Everything that you've been hearing
about is deadline-driven, meaning you have to meet the demands of
somebody who's telling you "I want work done in this area".  NSF, by
law, cannot do this.  Their charter is to process unsolicited
scientific proposals.  That means that you are free as scientists to
send in any kind of proposal that fits within any of the auspices and
programs of NSF.  A program manager cannot refuse to process your
proposal on technical grounds.  They can refuse to process it on
procedural grounds, for example, if you go over the page limit.  Every
proposal that NSF takes into a program must be peer reviewed.  A
program manager must have at least three peer reviews to be able to
either refuse or actually fund a proposal.  There's something called
the Guide to Programs which is available from NSF.  Call up the
general number and ask for it.  It lists all the programs at NSF; it
tells you how to get on-line proposal forms; it tells you how to
obtain, via e-mail, any kind of description for special initiatives,
for deadline information and so on. <P>

Pick up a copy of Grants for Research in Education, Science and
Engineering (GRESE).  This is the NSF book that has all the forms in
it for the research proposal.  Now you might go to your grants office,
and they'll say here are the forms.  A copy of the whole booklet is
what you really need, because the first half tells you what to write
into the blanks on the forms, how to structure the proposal, the page
limit what to emphasize and so forth.  You should really read this
carefully and then talk to the program director about how you might
want to organize your proposal.  You can use your program director at
NSF to help you decide what you're going to focus on in the proposal. <P>

Another booklet that is put out by all the NSF divisions in computer
science contains the abstracts of all proposals that got funding the
previous year.  It gives you a sense of what kinds of research NSF
funds and for how much.  So you might want to look at that. <P>

I'm going to touch on one other thing about writing a proposal,
because I want to really make it clear.  As Susan said, you need a
hypothesis and a method, but you also need an evaluation metric.  This
is especially important, and for the entire computer scientist
community.  That your program works is no longer good enough to
justify funding.  If you think that's your evaluation metric, you'll
never get anyplace.  You have got to be able to demonstrate that your
method worked and that it succeeded in achieving the speedup or
whatever else it is that you're claiming it was supposed to do. <P>

Some final comments.  On average it takes at least three resubmissions
to obtain NSF funding, if you're lucky.  So just know this up front.
You've got at least two years probably to get your first proposal
through.  Unless you happen to be a special case, or unless something
is really exciting about your research.  That's just the way it works. <P>

The Research Initiation Award program was mentioned before.  It is the
one that is especially important for people who have never had federal
funding. You can be tenured or non-tenured, but you cannot have had
federal funding.  It's meant to be startup money.  Why do the program
officers like it?  Because it requires only 10 percent overhead to the
university.  Ninety percent of the funding goes to research.  That's a
real important bottom line.  Use your grants office at your
institution.  Try to get them to help you find funding sources. <P>

My last point is: don't expect anybody to pat you on the head and help
you out.  I mean it just doesn't work that way.  There's nobody who's
going to say "Oh, you wrote another proposal.  That's really good."
So don't have this as your expectation.  For some of you, graduate
school has been a coddling experience.  You get a lot of positive
feedback, and you're really encouraged to do things.  This is gone.
You're on your own now. You shouldn't even complain about it.  Just
don't expect it to happen. And don't be shy.  You really do have to
take the aggressive attitude that you have got to pin people down and
make sure, for instance, that you set up your appointments and do
whatever else. <P>

Any questions from the floor?   <P>


<DT> <B>Question</B>
<DD> 

Hi. I've got one question for the last speaker.  Is it really possible
to arrange appointments with program directors?  You mentioned before
that people go and visit several places in Washington, D.C. during one
day. Is that being done?   <P>


<DT> <B>Gigley </B>
<DD> 

It's done all the time; that's the expected way to work.  Most
universities will even fund your trips if you go to your grants
office.  But it's up to you to contact the program officers and set up
your appointments.  Basically, as a program officer at NSF, most of
your work day is spent either talking on the phone or just sitting
down with people and having them present what they're doing.  It's
very accepted.  I just want to add that it's important that you get
the appointment and you have prepared what you are going to say.  You
have about 30 seconds to get his attention, so he'll listen to you for
the next half hour; they are very busy. <P>


<DT> <B>Question </B>
<DD> 

I have a question about what happens when you get that telephone call
from an NSF program director or someone else, and they say the panel
has reviewed your proposal and they really like it, but they have the
following concerns and would like you to cut your budget.  Can you
talk a little bit about that; can you give us some hints about
negotiation?  Answer (Eggers): I don't think it's a good idea to
negotiate dollars at NSF, but you might negotiate items, which, of
course, translates into dollars.  Answer (Gigley): My personal
experience is if they want you to cut, you take the cut.  You want the
grant.  It's pretty much what the NSF person is telling you: "This is
how many dollars I have, take it or leave it."  So then you can decide
what you want to change to make it fit.  Now your problem in
negotiation is on the university side.  You need to go back to your
university office and explain the situation to them and get them to
kick in more, so that they're not eating it all up in overhead.  I
mean the real negotiation can only be at your university side.  And
NSF won't touch that with a ten foot pole, because they stay out of
the politics at your university. <P>


<DT> <B>Question</B>
<DD> 

You talked about proposals in general.  I'm going to be writing a
Research Initiation Proposal next, and I was wondering if there was
anything different about those?  Anything special that I should know
about?   <P>


<DT> <B>Eggers </B>
<DD> 

I think all the topics I went through in talking about a proposal in
general, the heart of the proposal, apply to RIAs.  I can think of
only one additional point for RIAs.  They have a maximum amount of
money and a maximum number of years -- go for it.  But make sure that
what you're proposing to do is not outrageously small for the amount
of money you're asking or for the time.  But this is one of the few
situations other than ARPA in which you can go for the limit.   <P>


<DT> <B>Chen </B>
<DD> 

One more point with this question is that the Research Initiation
Award is actually evaluated by a panel instead of sending it out to
arbitrary referees.  It is extremely important to write a really
technically sound proposal, because you have a much higher chance of
getting funded through this channel.   <P>


<DT> <B>Eggers</B>
<DD> 

I should say that that is what we all suggest you do, apply for the
RIA.  It's funding geared for you; for people who have never had a
grant before.  So go for that first; your chances are better there. <P>


<DT> <B>Question (by same questioner on RIAs)</B>
<DD> 

At this point my only track record is my thesis work.  So do you have
any comments about how much I can leverage off that and how much I
should brag about that? <P>


<DT> <B>Eggers</B>
<DD> 

That's your track record.  Use it.  It will be the same for everyone
else applying for that type of grant.
