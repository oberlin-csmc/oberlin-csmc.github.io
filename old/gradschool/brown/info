Dear Prospective Applicant:

Thank you for your recent request for information on graduate study in
Computer Science at Brown University.  I am enclosing in the next
messages current information about the department, which is also
available on the World Wide Web at URL http://www.cs.brown.edu/programs/,
and via anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.brown.edu:/pub/info/.

We've forwarded your name and address to the Graduate School, and you
will soon be receiving the necessary application form and also
information on financial assistance.

Admission to the Ph.D. program is entirely separate from admission to
the Master's (Sc.M.) program; the Master's program does not continue
into the Ph.D. program.  Be sure to apply for the program you want.
The Department of Computer Science usually offers financial support to
candidates for the Ph.D. degree, but not to Master's candidates.  Ph.D.
candidates are offered either a fellowship, research assistantship, or
research/teaching assistantship, all of which include a stipend and
remission of tuition.  The application deadline for applicants seeking
financial support is January 2.

An official transcript of a completed Graduate Record Examination
(including the advanced subject test in either Computer Science,
Mathematics, or Engineering) is required for admission.  In addition,
applicants whose native language is not English and who have not
received a college degree from an institution in an English-speaking
country must take the TOEFL exam; a score of at least 625 is desired,
and of at least 600 is required for admission.  Further information on
graduate admissions is on the back of this page.

Ph.D. applicants are especially encouraged to apply for the graduate
fellowships offered by various government agencies and private
companies.  They are a great source of independent financial support
and can help your chances of admission to the Ph.D. program.  Some of
the principal agencies (and their phone numbers to call for application
forms) are:  A.R.P.A. (Battelle) (919-549-8505), O.N.R. (202-331-3500),
N.A.S.A. (202-358-1531), and Air Force (407-892-6146).  N.S.F. has an
address for their applications.  It is  N.S.F. Graduate Research
Fellowship, Oakridge Associated Universities, P.O. Box 3010, Oakridge,
TN 37381-3010, and their deadline is in early November, so apply soon.
If you are not a U.S. national, you should consult the fellowship
opportunities offered by your native government.

Thanks again for your interest in Brown!  Please feel free to contact
me by email at rt@cs.brown.edu or by phone at 401-863-7600 if you have
any questions.    Please include your email address in your
application.  For information on the status of your application, please
contact gradaps@cs.brown.edu by email.

Sincerely yours,

Roberto Tamassia

Chairman, Graduate Admissions
Department of Computer Science
Brown University
