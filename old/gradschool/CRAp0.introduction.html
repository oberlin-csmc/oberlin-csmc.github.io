<H1>Record of the cra workshop on academic careers for women
held at FCRC, San Diego, May 15, 1993</H1>

<H2>Program</H2>

<H3>8:00-8:15 Introduction and Welcome</H3>

The purpose of the workshop is to give women who are starting or ready
to start academic careers the practical information they need to
succeed.  The program is intended for people who will be at research
universities where a substantial research program is critical to
success. <P>

Cynthia Brown, Northeastern University


<H3>8:15-9:15 Session 1: The tenure decision.</H3>


Overview of what's needed (and what's not needed). Typical successful
research record at top and second-tier places. What's needed in
teaching. What's needed in service. Need for letters.  What to keep
track of so you can write a good tenure dossier.  How to describe your
research, teaching and service in the dossier. Choosing references,
and the protocol of how to approach them. Common pitfalls and
mistakes. (This gives an overview; several topics will be expanded on
later.) <P>

Chair: Maria Klawe, University of British Columbia. Panelist: Mary
Jane Irwin, Penn State University.

<H2>Beginning of transcript</H2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

Cynthia Brown <P>

Good morning everyone, and welcome to the workshop. I would like to
explain the format of the sessions and the way things are going to
work. We have seven sessions; each one is going to last about an hour.
In the first 40 minutes or so of the sessions the people on the panels
will present their ideas, and then the last 20 minutes are going to be
open for you to ask questions of the panelists. <P>

I've tried to get people who can really give you expert answers and I
want to strongly encourage everybody to take advantage of the question
period.  Here you have the experts available to you, so don't be shy
about coming forward and asking your questions.  If you do want to ask
a question, please use a microphone, since we are recording the
sessions. You are also welcome to make comments. After the conference
is over, we are going to make a transcript of everything that happens
and the people on the panels are going to have the opportunity to edit
what they say.  We would like to encourage a lot of free and open
discussion, so the people on the panels will have an opportunity to
edit their part of the transcript in case they said something that
they later think they don't want everybody in the Western Hemisphere
and part of Europe to see.  The people who are asking the questions
won't have the same opportunity but if you want to you can tell me
afterwards; you can just give me a note.  I made a comment in
such-and-such a panel and I am not really comfortable with it
appearing in the transcript, or something like that.  I hope that
won't happen, but I just want you to know that it is available and I
also want to let everyone know that the transcripts will be made
public. <P>

I am going to try to keep the sessions on schedule, so I will have to
cut off the discussions, no matter how interesting they may be, when
we get to the end of the time allotted for that session. Sorry to
have to be the bad guy, but that is the way it will have to work. <P>

Instead of my trying to introduce the people in
each session, I am going to ask each panel that the people just briefly
introduce themselves and say where they are from.  Ok, so that I think
takes care of all the administrative trivia connected with this
meeting.  Does anyone have a question before we begin? <P>

One other comment, though: it's really great to see so many people
here.  I know a lot of us sometimes feel that we are isolated or that
we are the only one, so just look around--we have more people coming,
you're not the only one. One of the main purposes of this meeting is
to help everybody to get to know the other women who are in computer
science and related fields.  You may have seen their names, you may be
on systers and have seen email, you may have talked to a lot of people
on email but now you have the chance to meet them face-to-face, so
again, take advantage of the opportunity in the breaks and at lunch
and get to know some of the people personally that you have only met
over electronic media. <P>
