Now that we've had a wonderful overview of what's required and what
the tenure process is like, we are going to start taking a closer look
at some of the specific aspects of a person's career.  We are going to
start with getting the job in the first place.  We all know how
competitive the job market has gotten.  Our next panel is going to
focus on the strategies for interviewing and what you do when you have
the interview and so on.  So, next panel please.


<DT> <B>Fran Berman</B>
<DD> 

Hi, I'm Fran Berman, I'm at UC, San Diego in the Computer Science
Department and we are going to talk a little bit about getting the job
and actually what you do in the first year or so after you've gotten
the job.  I have a distinguished panel with me today: Jill P. Mesirov
is director of Mathematical Sciences Research at Thinking Machines and
she is going to talk a little bit about the industry/ academic mix,
and Valerie Taylor is assistant professor at Northwestern University
in computer science.  I'm going to start off and give you an overview.
We are hoping that we'll have lots of time at the end for questions as
well. <P>

Here is what I am going to talk about <A HREF="CRAp2.slides">slide</A> 1.  The first three
bullets are "pre jobs".  We'll talk about optimizing your vita, how
people go about recruiting, and what kind of offer you should ask for.
This is something that I think women generally don't spend much time
thinking about.  And we'll talk about what you should do once you get
a job.  We will talk about real life at the end. <P>

Ok, let's talk about getting the job for those of you who are grad
students.  What's a good vita?  <A HREF="CRAp2.slides">slide</A> 2 This will vary from school
to school as will all this information, but there are a lot of things
that people look at in your vita.  Graduate students have a tendency
to think "Well, if I do a really great thesis, that will be really
important."  This is true, but there are a lot of other factors that
recruitment committees will look at.  One of the things they'll look
at is what school you come from and how famous your advisor is.  These
things will be relatively important.  If you come from a top school
with a relatively good advisor, that will count in your favor.  Of
course if you pick a Turing Award winner for your advisor, remember
that that Turing Award winner will also compare you when they write
you letters of recommendation to all their other students.  Pick an
advisor who is a good in their area and a good mentor.  Try hard to
really impress that advisor. Make sure that they can write you a
really good letter because those letters will count a lot. <P>

Another thing that recruitment committees will look at of course is
how good is your thesis.  They will look at your resume and try to
decide how many and what quality are your publications. There has been
a tremendous amount of inflation on publications.  I think that when
many of us got out of school, people had maybe one or two
publications. We now typically see vitas with a half dozen or more
publications in good conferences and refereed journals. Sometimes we
see vitas with a dozen publications!  Graduate students are having to
write a lot of stuff.  One thing you should think about as you go
through graduate school is to try to get out papers every year.  And
if you can do that, and if they are good papers, you can go to
conferences and give talks and start letting people know who you are.
That will really help you in getting a job.  So think about writing
papers, and write stuff up as you go along. Don't wait until your
thesis is through to write papers. <P>

Also, if you have any awards or special fellowships, that will help
your vita.  If you've been an IBM fellow, if you've worked at Xerox
over the summer, if you've worked at other places, those are things
that look good on your vita.  And you should try to do that as you go
along, so try to get on track even before you look for a job and these
things will help you.  People who know you will help you. <P>

Sometimes it's helpful to be a target of opportunity for some
departments and some years.  That can really depend on timing. Maybe a
department is getting a lot of pressure from the dean to hire
minorities or women or something like that.  Sometimes that's helpful
for you too.  There are some times when being a woman is helpful and
many times when being a woman is not so helpful as you all probably
know. <P>

How do you try to optimize these factors?  Given that you are already
at the institution that you are at and you probably already have an
advisor, what you want to try to do is optimize all the other factors
you can here.  Don't drop everything now and go to Berkeley and ask
Dick Karp to be your advisor!  Basically what you want to do is to get
good publications, and make sure you have good letters. To optimize
your letters, make sure that you letter-writers know something about
you.  Saying "I had Jane in class and she was the best student in
class and she got an A+."  is not an especially good letter.  Saying
"You know, Jane's come to me and she has talked about a bunch of
research ideas, and there is real creativity here. She has done a lot
of interesting work in field X." That's a good letter.  These are the
kinds of letters you want to try to cultivate. <P>

So, what's the recruiting process?  Well, the first thing you do is to
send an application. We get hundreds of applications and most other
schools will too.  There has to be a way to differentiate them, and
that's where you try to optimize your vita and all your other factors.
A certain set of those applications will be followed up by requesting
letters on them.  Now one way you can get letters requested on you is
to actually track your application at the school: Have your advisor or
somebody you know at your institution call somebody else at University
X and say "Gee, I have this good student who is applying. Can you
check and see how that person is doing?"  A lot of time if a faculty
member walks in and says "I'd like to see some letters on this
person.", your file will get through to the next level. So one thing
you want to do is try to track your applications and get as many
people at as many universities as you can kind of watching out for
you. That helps a lot. <P>

After your letters have been received, there will be a lot of
discussion.  Some programmatic needs will be discussed, some political
maneuvering will happen; it's kind of a mystical process and either
the recruitment chair or a committee or the whole department will
decide on a group of people to interview.  If you are one of those
asked for an interview, then you actually have gotten through a fairly
narrow bottleneck, because departments don't like to interview
zillions of people.  The most we're ever interviewed for multiple
positions is 20 and that's a lot.  Mostly it's 4 or 5 or 8 or
something like that.  I'll talk about the interview itself briefly in
a moment.  After the interview, there will be a lot of discussion.
The outcome will be a result of how you did on the interview but also
how everybody else did on their interview.  Also a result of politics:
the guys in VLSI will want a faculty member in VLSI and the guys in
theory will want someone in theory.  It may be relevant who was hired
last year and whose "turn" it is this year.  It may be hard to tell at
this point what's going to go on, but if things go well, you'll get an
offer.  Then you start negotiating.  We'll talk about that in a
moment. <P>

I'm going to talk only briefly about the interview <A HREF="CRAp2.slides">slide</A> 3.  There
is a wonderful summary on academic systers and Nancy Leveson promised
me that if you wait for a week and ask her about it, then there will
be a place from which you can actually FTP it. <P>

Let me briefly go over a typical interview day.  A typical day will be
exhausting but it will also be fun, so get enough sleep and be
prepared for it.  Wear clothes that make you feel confident.  First,
you'll have breakfast with your host. There will be meetings,
meetings, meetings, and more meetings. They will generally be from 30
to 60 minutes. You will meet with other faculty, you might meet with
groups of students, you might meet with a dean, or you might not meet
with a dean, you will have lunch with a group from your department.
Your talk will be either in the morning or in the afternoon.  There
will be more meetings all around it, and then there will be dinner
with a group from your department.  So typically that's an exhausting
day.  There are some things you can do to make a good impression. <P>

You should practice your talk at least three times in front of an
audience.  This is critical.  The first time you give your talk, you
should give it to your lab or seminar group or whatever, and they will
give you lots of hopefully constructive comments.  You should go back
and completely redo your talk.  Then you should find another lab group
and give it to them.  Then you should completely redo it again. I have
a student who applied for a job at a small liberal arts college this
year and there were 400 applicants for this job.  We went through his
interview talk four different times and by the fourth time it was a
wonderful talk and he got the job.  I was really really very pleased
about that.  The way the talk changed from the beginning to the end
was significant.  So get good feedback.  The other thing doing your
talk three or four times does, is it kind of puts it on automatic
pilot.  We all get nervous in front of an audience and knowing your
talk well will help minimize the effect of your nervousness. <P>

Another thing you should do is read up on the department you are going
to visit and your potential colleagues. It is very important to know
what they are doing and to think a little bit about where you are
going to fit in.  What they are going to do when they interview you is
figure out where you would fit into the department, and the more
champions you can make, the better off you are going to be during the
discussion part. <P>

You should be able to describe your research succinctly in about five
minutes to people before their eyes start glazing over. Make it sound
exciting and know what you are going to do after your thesis.  You've
done this wonderful piece of work and people say "What are you going
to do next?" If you say, "Well, I don't know.", it doesn't make a good
impression.  Know your stuff. <P>

You should be prepared to talk with all kinds of people and in fact
you might ask to talk with the systems staff.  These are people that
you are going to be working closely with if you use equipment. It's
nice to know the configuration before you get there.  It's nice to
know how the kind of equipment you are going to use will fit in, so
talk to them. <P>

When do you tell people about the two body problem?  My feeling about
assistant professor jobs is that it's probably best to mention it at
the interview stage and not in the initial letter.  I wouldn't say
that for more senior people but I would say that at the assistant
professor level because there are so many hoops you have to jump
through that you don't want to be excluded from the pool even before
you've gotten there.  Wait until the interview and wait until the
right time to mention the fact you have a partner who will also need a
reasonable job.  Sometime during the day you can say "Well you know
I've got a partner in sociology and our first priority is to find jobs
in the same place."  (if it is).  At some point you have to say
something really, but I would say to wait until the right time. <P>

If you have children or are planning on having children, you want to
ask about daycares, benefits, parental leave, etc.  Ask a person (a)
who is likely to know about this and (b) with whom you feel
comfortable asking these questions.  For some people these are not
very good questions to ask.  So use your good judgement here. <P>

It's actually illegal for us to ask you things about your marital
status, children, etc.  Some people may bring it up anyway because
they are trying to be friendly and helpful.  I sometimes bring it up
with candidates saying "By the way, if you have children we have a
really good daycare center at UCSD."  You don't have to respond to
these statements if you don't want to. <P>

Let's see, you should look like you are interested in the job. I can't
tell you how many candidates have come through who actually don't look
like they are that interested. You know it's their ninth
interview---Laughter---you know they are tired, they don't want to
interview anymore, they don't want to talk to another person about
their area.  This is not good when we discuss these people. We say
"Well you know so and so came through but I don't think they will
really take a job here."  If people think that, you are much less
likely to get an offer. <P>

And you actually do want to get an offer, you especially want to get
your first offer. Once you get your first offer, you can call up the
school you really want to go to and say "Well UCSD made me an offer.
Are you guys going to make an offer anytime soon?".  Sometimes you can
leverage things a little bit.  So there are lots of things to think
about.  As I said, get the systers summary and there is a lot of good
advice in there about interviewing. <P>

OK, so you've gotten through this hoop and the mystical discussion
process has gone on and you finally get an offer at the school you
want to go to.  All is not over yet, you really want to do some
negotiation at this point.  <A HREF="CRAp2.slides">slide</A> 4.  This has really changed over
the years.  I graduated from the University of Washington with my PhD
in 1979 and I went to Purdue as an assistant professor.  I remember
calling up to accept the job and they had offered me $17,500 which
actually was a reasonable amount of money then!  When I called up to
accept the job, I talked to the guy who was my host and he said "The
other guy we gave an offer to is getting $18,000 so you should ask for
that."  So you know I waited and I called the department chair and I
said "OK, I'd like $18,000" and he said OK! ------Laughter------Of
course it's different these days, but it's still important to
negotiate for a good package. <P>

In some places you can negotiate for salary. At a place like UCSD, you
can't negotiate for salary but you can negotiate for rank which
actually gives you a higher or lower salary.  You can negotiate for
reducing your teaching load or your committee work load during the
first year.  This is a great idea.  If you can get reduced teaching
and committee work during the first year, it will really pay off.  So
try to do that.  Sometimes you can negotiate for RA support. Equipment
-- you certainly want to get the best equipment you can.  Sometimes
you can get things like discretionary budget or travel funds, summer
salary, moving expenses, etc.  Sometimes you can get them to help you
with the two body problems as part of your offer.  What you really
want to do is to get as much as you can as part of the initial offer.
Now note that the pot of money that most schools have for new faculty
is different than the pot of money that they have for existing
faculty.  So you will never again have the opportunity to negotiate as
well as you can negotiate now.  And it's a completely different source
of funds.  If you don't ask for an RA now and plan to ask for an RA
when you get there, you may not get one because they may have startup
money for RAs but no general department funds for RAs.  So this is the
best time to ask for what you think you'll need. <P>

So you've made the best offer you can and you are now a new assistant
professor and ready to start at your new place.  <A HREF="CRAp2.slides">slide</A> 5 I'm going
to talk about getting started a little bit and then I'm going to give
the floor over to my distinguished colleagues here. <P>

<A HREF="CRAp2.slides">slide</A> 6 The first thing you want to do is you want to establish
yourself as a researcher, and to do that there are some basic things
that every first year person ought to be doing.  You ought to write a
grant proposal.  There are lots of good grant programs around.  NSF
has some for new faculty (the Research Initiation grants).  Take the
fall and spend that time writing a grant proposal. <P>

You should try to think about starting a research program at your
institution and there are lots of ways to do that.  You can teach a
course in your research area. Try to do that in the first year --
that's a good way to attract students and to get people to know what
you do.  Give talks.  Let your colleagues know what you do.  Start or
participate in a seminar in your research area.  I'm in parallel
processing.  I started a weekly seminar in parallel processing at UCSD
because there was none.  In that seminar, we give research talks,
practice talks for conferences and interviews, talks on work in
progress and have guest speakers.  It's been very helpful to our lab
group. <P>

You should write up the papers from your dissertation.  You are going
to be sick to death of it, you are going to think that anybody could
have come up with the ideas in your dissertation by the time you are
done with it, your dog could have done it, right?---Laughter---It's
true, but write papers anyway.  Write up all the papers you can from
your dissertation.  It will enable you to close that chapter and go on
to something new and moreover, this is what you are known for so far.
So really write all of that stuff up, leverage your dissertation if
you can. <P>

You want to start thinking about tenure this early.  What Janie said
and what Maria said was exactly right.  You'll want to start thinking
now kind of informally about who you are going to ask for letters, so
you'll want to start developing a research network.  Go to conferences
and start developing a group of colleagues. Start giving talks and
really start making those connections now, that's the best thing you
can do.  Those letters of recommendation will really be key at tenure
time.  Start thinking about it now and people will have a long history
with you and that will be good.  They will be able to write you a
letter that says "I've known Jane since she was a beginning assistant
professor. Her work has really matured. It is now the best work I know
of in this area.", and that is a good thing for a letter to say.  So
establish yourself as researcher and think about this your very first
year. <P>

<A HREF="CRAp2.slides">slide</A> 7 Ok, you also have to live in your department; that's your
community so you need to establish yourself as a departmental
presence. Your department like everyone else's department is going to
have sort of strange rituals and ways of dealing with each other and
you need to figure out what those are before you jump in.  The most
diplomatic people I know spend some time laying low figuring out who
are the reasonable guys, who are the unreasonable guys, who are the
powerful guys, who are the not powerful guys, and just observing their
department. So spend some time figuring out kind of who is who and
that will really help you a lot in your dealings with the department.

It's very helpful to find local mentors. You could send me some email
and say "What should I do about this?"  but if you are not at UCSD I
may not be able to really give you good advice.  You need to find safe
reasonable people to talk to in your department.  There may not be
very many, there may be a whole ton of them, but find some people that
you can talk to. Go to lunch with those people and develop those
relationships, so when it comes time for people to discuss your file
they will know you pretty well. <P>

You should always be nice to staff and systems people, I think it's
really important. First of all it's just the right thing to do.  Staff
and systems people are often under appreciated and they could use a
little of your good will.  Second of all it's a politically astute
thing to do because staff and systems people can be extremely helpful
to you.  Knowing the right secretary to do the right thing, and having
the systems person be willing to come in at 2:00 in the morning to
reboot some machine is a really valuable thing and you should take
some care to really cultivate those relationships. <P>

You should be collegial and professional with your colleagues. That
goes without saying, and I'm sure you all know how to do that already.
You should also volunteer sparingly.  In your first year, you may want
to go in and be a team player or go in and get involved with
everything, but you know you have a lot to do in your first year.
Volunteer sparingly, do a good job when you do volunteer, but don't
volunteer for everything.  Pace it. <P>

<A HREF="CRAp2.slides">slide</A> 8 Lets see, where are we?  Teaching.  Well we are going to
have a panel on teaching so I only have a few bullets on this.  I
think we do a good job of teaching because we are at universities and
that's really the right thing to do.  Do the best job you can, treat
your students with respect, treat them like adults.  Don't bake
cookies -- this is my slide.---Laughter---.  You can
take your students out for a beer, that's fine, but don't bake
cookies!  ----Laughter---.  You should have a realistic role of
teaching at your institution.  Know if teaching counts.  At some
institutions teaching does count, at some institutions they talk about
teaching counting, but it doesn't.  Generally teaching does not help
your tenure file.  However, it may hinder your file if they are
looking for an excuse.  We had a faculty member who spent an enormous
amount of time teaching, I think to the exclusion of research, and this
faculty member didn't get through.  I was very sad to see that, so be
very realistic about this, this is really important. <P>

<A HREF="CRAp2.slides">slide</A> 9 My last thoughts are about real life. I think that this is
an incredibly important topic.  You may not get a lot of encouragement
to have one, but you should definitely have a real life.  You may be
shocked at how many of your colleagues sing in rock bands, have run
marathons, are brownie leaders, have rafted down the Colorado River,
etc. but they might not talk to you about this the first 10 times you
talk to them.  Many people in computer science, not everyone, but many
people have a real life.  ----Laughter----.  They usually are discrete
about it and you should consider this too.  The reason to be discrete
about your real life is because people may not know you yet and they
need to form a professional impression of you. <P>

After a certain point, discretion is not so important.  When I first
came to UCSD, I focused on work in conversations with my colleagues.
Now if I leave work at 3:00 to see my daughter be a fork in her dance
production, I'll tell people about that.  But by now, people in my
department know me and don't worry that I'm not productive.  I
wouldn't have talked about this in the beginning.  Have a real life
because that makes you feel OK about yourself, and that's good for you
as a person. <P>

You should also have friends who are not in computer science, I think
this is really important -- there is a whole world out there. In fact
you should have friends who are not academics!  I think all of this is
important and good for your mental health. <P>

I'm now going to give the floor over to Jill who has a great set of
slides, and also a real life!  Laughter---. <P>

You will just have to believe me that I have a real life.  I'm going
to talk a little bit about industry verses academia.  There are so
many things that Fran said that hold true whether you are looking for
an academic or an industrial job.  So I will try not to repeat them
and will try to talk about some orthogonal issues. <P>

<DT> <B><A HREF="CRAp2.slides">Slide</A> 2</B>
<DD> 

I think the first thing I want to mention is what the opportunities
are in industry.  There are really three areas in which people work in
industry: there is research, there is development, and then there is
marketing and sales. It's not always easy to put each of these areas
into its own little compartment.  There is a wide spectrum that runs
between research and development and between R&D and marketing and
sales.  I'm not really going to talk about marketing and sales because
that's really not what I do, and I'm not that interested in doing it
but it can provide tremendous economic opportunities to people with
the right personalities and interests.  If I sound a little
prejudiced, maybe I am, so let me not say anymore. <P>


<DT> <B><A HREF="CRAp2.slides">Slide</A> 3 </B>
<DD> 

But I do want to talk about research and development which are things
that I know more about and to try to give you an idea of what the
difference is between the two. Also, I want you to keep in the back of
your minds that a lot of tremendously important research in computer
science is done in in industrial development groups.  So, to say one
is doing is working in a development group is not necessarily to say
that one is not involved in some research activities.  What
characterizes a development group?  Development is product driven. A
development group's main reason for existence is to produce some kind
of product.  There tends to be a lot of stress in development groups
for that reason. Schedules are tight, and if schedules aren't met the
company sees an immediate lost or problem arising from that.  So if
you've promised a product to a customer or to a client and it's not
ready on time that can have tremendous repercussions.  On the other
hand it can yield tremendous payoffs in terms of money and also in
terms of advancement. If you do do a great job in a development group
then the opportunities that are opened up for you within a company can
be endless.  It's a case of taking a risk and getting a big pay off.
Another thing that tends to characterize development groups is that
the work is fairly well defined or described by somebody else and not
by you.  Now that depends where you sit in the development group and
how high up in the hierarchy of the company you are, naturally.  But
if you are just sort of a new member of a development group it is most
likely that somebody else will tell you what you will be working on,
and they may tell you how to do it. That doesn't mean you might not
see a better way to do it. A judicious voicing of that opinion is
often very helpful to companies in the long run. <P>

One or the nice things about being in a development group is that you
do get the satisfaction of seeing the utility of your work fairly
immediately, and there is a finished product at the end.  That product
maybe used by millions of people, and that can be a tremendously
satisfying thing.  When you write papers you often feel lucky if a few
people read them, so there is a tremendous difference there. <P>


<DT> <B><A HREF="CRAp2.slides">Slide</A> 4</B>
<DD> 

Research is a very different sort of endeavor and in fact there are
very few basic research jobs in industry.  There are some famous labs,
for example, Bell Labs and IBM labs, that you probably are aware of.
There is some basic research that is done in other companies but again
I think the number of opportunities in basic research in industry is
fairly small.  On the other hand there are a tremendous number of
applied research jobs in industry. These are often interdisciplinary
jobs that are on the interface between engineering and computer
science or between computer science and science or between computer
science and mathematics.  They often require, because of this
interdisciplinary nature, very good communication skills, both verbal
and written.  If you are working with somebody who has a different
technical background than you it is incumbent upon you to be able to
communicate what you know technically in such a way that they can
understand it.  This may not be the same thing as communicating it to
somebody who has the same technical background as you do.  Applied
research can mean many things.  It can mean research towards a
particular application area, it can be research towards a particular
product development area, it can be applied research in software
areas, it can be applied research in hardware development areas.  So
there is a wide range of opportunities in these areas.  Again some of
these applied research jobs do exist in what are nominally development
groups. <P>

One of the things about research in industry is that one really needs
to worry about the bottom line.  It is the profits of a company which
support the research efforts in that company.  That means that when
times are good in a company, there is a lot of opportunity to do more
basic and undirected research. But, when times are bad, everybody
looks at the research group and says, "What are we paying them for?"
That's ok, because if you are in such a research group, then you
believe they are paying you for a good reason.  However, you have to
keep this attitude in mind and be aware that you need to constantly
keep your colleagues in other areas of the company, and your
management, aware of the importance of what you are doing and how it
relates to the bottom line of the company.  And that's something to
always remember if you are in a research group in a company.  The next
point just goes along with that.  It really is important to understand
what the company's long rang goals, and marketing and development
strategies are, and how what you are doing relates to them.  This is
all part of understanding where you fit and how you are contributing
and justifying what you are doing in terms of that bottom line. <P>


<DT> <B><A HREF="CRAp2.slides">Slide</A> 5</B>
<DD> 

What are some of the issues that are involved in making a choice
between academia and industry?  There are many of them and I've just
tried to point out a few.  First, there is the issue of flexibility.
There is a very wide range of opportunity in industry, much wider than
in academia and, if you think about what that means in terms of job
availability, there are more positions available.  To make that
statement true, you have to recall that you might be doing research in
a group that is nominally not a research group.  There is also
geographic flexibility.  If you are restricted to some geographical
area, then industrial jobs are probably going to present you with more
opportunity than if you just consider an academic position. <P>

On the other hand, academia gives you another kind of flexibility.
The flexibility of what you work on may be much greater in academia
because research and development are tied to the bottom line in a
company and that may somewhat restrict what you work on.  Also one's
schedule can be more flexible in an academic job.  Of course that
depends on the particular company or group, but I would say that if
you integrate over all jobs, then it's probably more flexible in
academia than it is in industry.  In academia you don't have to teach
during the summer, and you can concentrate completely on your
research.  That's nice!  There is also the opportunity to take
sabbaticals and visit other places.  Those opportunities are much more
restricted in industry. <P>

What about security?  You know there was a whole session in this
workshop about getting tenure.  Long term, tenure in academia gives
you a lot of security. Short term, industrial jobs may give you more
security because once you are hired by a company that's it.  Now long
term, that industrial job may not give you as much security.
Companies can go out of business, companies change functions,
companies under stress may jettison whole groups.  So, long term, you
may not have as much security, but short term you will. That's the
trade off. <P>

What about teaching?  One of the advantages of industry is that you
don't have to worry about students. One of the disadvantages of
industry is that there are no students around.  --- Laughter----. I
really mean that. One of the nice things about having students is that
they are constantly questioning you, raising new issues, forcing you
to look at different view points, forcing you to keep current in your
field.  There's a tremendous number of advantages to having students
around, but they can be a tremendous strain on your time also.  So I
think there are trade offs both ways. <P>

Keeping current -- in many industrial positions you have to make a
much more conscious effort to keep current in your field, to keep
abreast of the literature, and to know what's going on. In academia
that's more or less considered part of the job.  That's what you are
doing when you are teaching courses, especially graduate courses. <P>

What about attitudes toward women?  I don't think there is a
tremendous difference in the attitude towards women in industry and
academia.  Although I will say my experience in industry is that it's
probably tougher towards the research and development end of the
spectrum than in the marketing and sales end.  And I certainly have
had the experience of being the only technical person in a meeting
with a customer and had the customer ask all the technical questions
to the sales person, who didn't know a thing, just because the sales
person was male.  Well, they soon find out who knows the answers to 
their questions. <P>


<DT> <B><A HREF="CRAp2.slides">Slide</A> 6</B>
<DD> 

Why did I make the choice to go into industry?  I made the choice
based on the flexibility issue because I had a severe two body
problem. My husband is an academic, and I wanted to be in the same
place that he was. I have found that, for me, this has worked out
tremendously well both scientifically and by affording me more
flexibility in finding jobs where I needed to go.  It's not the right
answer for everybody and different people will put different emphasis
on different requirements in their lives. <P>


<DT> <B><A HREF="CRAp2.slides">Slide</A> 7</B>
<DD> 

Fran talked a lot about issues in interviewing and how to present
yourself and I think all these issues are very very similar in looking
for academic and industrial jobs; I'm thinking now with a little bit
more emphasis on research jobs in industry.  I thought I'd just talk
about a few things that one might want to be conscious of in
interviewing for industrial jobs and in trying to make decisions about
whether to go into a particular opening in industry. <P>

First, I think it's important to remember that an interview is not
just your perspective employer interviewing you, but it's also you
interviewing your perspective employer. You want to find out, " Am I
going to be happy in this job?  Is this what I want to do for the next
N years of my life?" Where N might be anything between two and fifty.
Right?  Therefore, you want to get a good answer to those two
questions when you go in and talk to people during that long day from
breakfast through dinner. <P>

For example, what's the sort of distribution here between applied and
undirected research?  If you are going to a place like Bell Labs it's
pretty obvious but there are a lot of other places that you might go
where it's not so obvious so you want to get as accurate a picture of
the research environment as possible. <P>

Who will set your research agenda?  You?  Your manager?  Someone else?
Some people actually prefer some external guidance.  You might not
mind being led in certain directions, or you might find that to be a
complete anathema.  Only you know the answer to that question. <P>

What are the career paths at the company?  Will you have the
opportunity, if there tend to be lots of projects going on, to set
some directions.  If you are interested in management, or eventually
research management, will you be able to move up?  Is there a
technical career path?  Some companies have both administrative or
management career paths and purely scientific career paths, and some
don't.  Maybe you don't want to ever be a manager but you want to know
that your salary is not going to stop going up at a certain point
because there is no where else to go. <P>

How flexible is the place in terms of publications?  There are some
companies which do not allow you to publish, not because your are
working on state secrets, but because you are working on company
secrets.  So you want to find out what are the proscriptions on
publication of your work, or, on the other hand, are you encouraged to
publish a lot?  Are you encouraged to, and are you supported to,
travel to meetings to speak about your work?  Because if you are
working in industrial or academic research you want to be able to let
people know what you are doing and you want to make connections in the
outside world.  One of the main ways to do that is to go to meetings,
have outside collaborators, and to give talks.  So you will want to
know whether or not the company is going to support you and to what
extent.  Also what about professional community service, what about
serving on program committees for conferences, what about other kinds
of professional community service?  Will the company pay your travel
for that?  Will they understand and do they believe that that's a good
use of your time?  Do they not?  You have to understand all those
issues so that you can make decisions about whether to say yes or like
Nancy Reagan says, "JUST SAY NO". <P>

What is the salary scale? How do salaries compare with academic offers
that you may have? <P>

What are the company's goals and strategies?  That's very important!
Do they align with your own research interests, with what you want to
do? <P>

Are there other women around?  This is more important to some people
than to others.  Some people like to be pioneers, they like to be the
only woman forging ahead. Other people like to have other women
around.  This is something that you know about yourself.  If there are
other women around, you may want to talk to them and find out what the
environment is like for women. <P>

What's your boss like?  That's a really important question. A chair in
an academic department is nominally your boss, but in terms of what
you do day to day, and what your research program is, a chair will
have much less to say about it than your manager in an industrial
environment.  How does your manager view the group goals and the
company's goals?  Do people in the group tend to work as individuals
or do they tend to work in groups?  What criteria will your manager
use to evaluate your work?  Will it be evaluated by how it affects the
company's bottom line?  Will it be evaluated by the quality of journal
in which it is published?  Will you be evaluated by how much you
interact with the development groups in the company?  What are the
rules here so to speak?  It's just like finding out what it takes to
get tenure in academia. <P>

What kind of hardware and software environment will you be provided
with?  That's a very important question.  I have been in a situation,
going into a company, where one development station was shared by four
or five developers, so you can imagine that you could never get your
work done unless you came in between two and six in the morning and
actually that's when everybody came in so they could get their work
done too. <P>


<DT> <B><A HREF="CRAp2.slides">Slide</A> 8</B>
<DD> 

What's the group or the company like to work in?  And here I think
it's very important not to take the surface impression for granted.
If you know somebody, if you have a friend, or a friend of a friend,
who works at that company, then call them up and say,"What's the real
scoop here?  What's really going on here?  What's it really like
here?"  This can be a very important thing to do, and it's probably to
do in an academic job search too.  Try to meet your future colleagues
in a less formal setting then the interview. <P>

Finally, I think it's very important not to say that you will work on
something that you don't want to work on, because you won't be happy
and neither will the company.  Don't say "Yes, I will work on a
runtime system for this machine," with the idea that in six months
time you will finagle your way into doing something else.  That's
really a recipe for disaster. <P>


<DT> <B><A HREF="CRAp2.slides">Slide</A> 9</B>
<DD> 

The last thing I want to just mention is: what does it take to survive
in a nonacademic situation?  The best way to survive and to succeed is
to do great work.  That's always true anywhere.  To do great work and
to make sure people know that you are doing great work and what that
work is.  Don't get distracted by side issues and projects.  That's
the same as Fran saying don't volunteer too readily. On the other if
you see something that needs to be done, and you think its important,
it probably is. If you can, convince somebody of that fact, and do it.
That kind of initiative is very well rewarded.  Pick your mentors wisely
and that's a combination of social and technical things.  Your mentor
has to be somebody that you can get along with as well as somebody
that can guide you technically.  Somebody who is a good mentor for one
person may not be a good mentor for another person.  Listen! Keep your
ears to the ground, figure out what's going on that's beneath the
surface.  Keep up your external contacts and collaborations. That's
really important.  If you want to do research in an industrial
position, you have to to know what's going on outside.  Know what your
strengths are and where you will succeed more readily.   <P>

And finally...  You know I put this on this list, TAKE CARE MIXING
WORK AND PLAY.  Somebody asked me last night, "What does that mean?
You mean you shouldn't play tennis with the guy in the office next
door?"  No.  Quite frankly, what I mean here, and I didn't want to
write it down but let's be explicit, I mean be very careful about
dating your colleagues and especially about dating your manager.  You
know, it's something that people think about and they don't say, but
it can cause you a lot of grief, and naive attitudes about such things
can often result in personal hardship.  And yes, there are lots of
special cases, and every case is different, and so on and so forth,
but I think as a default strategy, that's the right one.  It's tough
enough for women out there without people dismissing you for this kind
of reason.  ---APPLAUSE --- <P>

<DT> <B>Valerie Taylor</B>
<DD> 

Hi I'm Valerie Taylor and I'll give you the perspective from a person
that's going through the process of chasing tenure.  I am a second
year assistant professor at Northwestern University in the EECS
department.  First I'll start off talking about my interview
experiences, then I'll talk about building your lab and managing your
time.  So in terms of my interview experiences I visited 6
universities. One thing that I would strongly recommend is that you
visit more than 6 universities.  I limited myself to only 6 because of
exhaustion and time constraints to finish my dissertation.  I was
trying to balance interviewing with finishing and since I had received
the offer that I really wanted I stopped interviewing and focused on
my dissertation.  Another thing that you want to do when you are
interviewing is to try to visit various universities and research labs
because it will give you a chance to meet other people in the field.
Realize that those people are going to be the ones that will review
your proposals and review your papers.  It's good to meet these people
during the interview process so that they will get a chance to learn
about your work in the context of a small audience, which generally
consists of a few professors and some grad students.  So you have a
small audience in which to present your work and then everyone can ask
one-on-one questions.  It gives them a great opportunity to learn more
about your research.  Again try to visit a large number of
universities and research institutions. <P>

One of the many things that I considered in terms of my offer was the
start up package, which included travel for conferences.  The travel
budget is very important.  When you walk into the office and you have
to buy a ticket, where do you get the money to buy the ticket?  You
want to be sure that it's included in your start up package.  I
received money for two conferences per year for the first two years.
Another aspect of the start up package is summer salary.  When you
walk in the door you don't have a grant and it takes time to obtain a
grant, which is the source of summer salary.  The first year you are
writing a proposal and then it takes time before you get the results
of the proposal.  Further it takes time to set up the account.
Generally, at least one summer will have passed before you have a
source for summer salary.  If possible, try to get summer salary for
the first two years included in the start up package.  Another
important aspect of the package was support for students.  I will get
to that later, well let me discuss it now.  When you get student
support one thing you want to consider is the difference between RA
support and TA support.  RA support is very nice because the student
is working on research full time beyond classes.  With TA support, 20
hours of the student's time is devoted to working and helping out with
the course.  They are not doing research during these 20 hours.  I
asked for student support and when I arrived at NU I found out that it
was TA support.  So during the interview process or when you are
negotiating the offer find out if it is TA support or RA support
because it is very different.  Another important aspect of the package
is the teaching load.  At Northwestern it is really nice because we
are given one course per quarter for the academic year and no teaching
over the summer.  I was very explicit about asking about the teaching
load at the various universities.  At state universities the course
load may be dictated by the state and you may have to off load your
course requirements with monitoring grad students.  It was very
important to me that I not have a large course load or be required to
have large number of grad students. <P>

Second on the list is a supportive environment where people
collaborate and they don't mind sharing information.  I realized that
during my first year I needed a lot of advice and help and I wanted to
make sure that that particular environment provided that.  Another
aspect was class size, which was important, well class size and TA
support.  I would often ask about the ratio of students to TA in a
course.  At Northwestern for undergraduate classes if you have beyond
23 students you automatically get a TA.  And so that's very important
because if you have a class size of 60 and you don't have a TA then
you are grading 60 papers and you are looking at 60 different hand
writings, 60 different interpretation of the problem, and 60 different
exams to grade.  This can be a tremendous load when added on to doing
research, working with grad students. working on committees, and then
attempting to have a life of your own.  So, one thing you want to
consider is the TA support and class the size. <P>

Lastly, even though it's at the last part of the list it was very
important, was salary.  I asked people that were interviewing at the
same time if they wouldn't mind sharing what they received in terms of
salary offer.  I asked both male and female to find out what was the
range and to find out if I was getting the average salary.  So that's
one thing you want to consider.  Then I learned also that the salary
is given in terms of the 9 month academic year.  Further, you want to
find out how your salary is distributed over the year.  Some
universities give you the academic salary over the 12 month period and
some universities give you the academic salary over the 9 month
period.  So it varies. <P>

<A HREF="CRAp2.slides">slide</A> 2 When setting up your research lab, be sure to negotiate for
the following.  Desk space or lab space.  Be sure to negotiate for
this prior to signing the contract because once you get there it's
hard to negotiate for desk space or lab space.  I used the average of
three students and I would say can I have enough space for three
students and equipment.  Consider what happens when you purchase
equipment, where will it go?  So you want to be sure that you do have
some space for your students and your equipement.  Negotiate for
funding of students and lab equipment.  Be honest about what you need.
List the items you need along with the dollar amounts.  Attempt to
replicate your grad school environment.  When I was considering my
equipment needs, I tried to duplicate the environment that I had at
Berkeley as a grad student.  Once you start working on the job they
ask you to produce immediately.  And so you don't want to have to
spend time learning a whole bunch of different tools and getting a
whole bunch of executable files just to produce a document.  Inlude
money for software and equipment for your grad students as well as
yourself. <P>

Once you have your lab, be selective when taking on grad students.
One thing I learned from Dave Patterson, via Corinna Lee, was to look
at the number of hours in a day or the number of hours in a week and
count how many hours you have for grad students.  So I decided I only
had three hours left out of the week---Laughter--- where I could try
to keep up with their projects.  Given that I like to meet with each
grad student one hour per week, I have three grad students.  I didn't
take on any grad students until the end of my first year.  I waited
until I had the students in my class where I could actually find out
about their background and determine if they are really interested in
my particular area of reasearch.  You don't want to take on too many
students; it will eat up your time significantly. <P>

The last item in terms if setting up your research lab, is to be sure
to have one research project of your own.  When you start as an
assistant professor, often you will have first year grad students.
It's not very often that you go in and get senior grad students.  With
first year grad students it takes time before the grad students can
produce results and papers.  It takes time for them to get the
background they need.  In constrast if you do the project it's a very
short turn around time given that you find the time in the week.
----Laughter---It's a very short turn around time before you can
actually get some results.  So it's very good to have one project that
you are doing for which you are not relying on grad students to
produce papers.  Further, it gives you a chance to publish papers
where you are the sole author.  So that's one thing to keep in mind,
and plus working on a research project of your own will cause you to
stay current and to consider other research projects. <P>

<A HREF="CRAp2.slides">slide</A> 3 Lastly, I'll discuss balancing your load which I am still
learning to do but I will discuss some of the things I 've learned so
far.  First, be honest with your time.  There are only 24 hours in a
day.  Seven days in a week, you know, and four weeks in a month.  No
matter how hard I try, I can work 25 hours and it's still the next
day---Laughter, laughter, laughter---.  So I can only allot 24 hours
and I've missed some deadline if I go beyond that.  So be honest with
your time in terms of saying you can only get a limited amount of work
done.  You will end up saying no to some people.  For example with
grad students I had to say I only have three hours and I can only take
on three students.  When I have my three students, which I have right
now, I decided I can't take on anymore. <P>

Second, delegate as much as possible.  As a grad student you do
everything.  You're doing the copying, writing your paper, writing
correspondences, you're doing all of it.  And when you become an
assistant professor your responsibilities are so varied that you need
to delegate some of the responsibilities to the staff.  To give you an
example, I have a limited amount of money in my accounts so I need to
know every penny that I have available so that I will know how much to
spend for travel, etc.  Initially, when I received my account
statements I would go through them to make sure there were no
accounting errors.  Now I've asked the secretary if she could keep up
with all of my expenditures and now when the account statements come
in she goes through them.  She calls people to correct the account and
it gives me an extra hour that I can use for something else.  So try
to delegate as much as possible. <P>

Third, as mentioned previously, don't take on too many students.  Be
very selective about activities and committees and find out how much
work is required for a committee or an activity before you say yes.
Find out as much information as possible.  And one thing you want to
do is talk to other people and find out what you can say no to and try
to say no as much as possible. <P>

Another thing is to be aware of hidden time sinks.  For example, I
realized that when I walk through the halls a lot of times I enjoy
stopping to talk--Laughter-- So what I had to do is to be aware of
that and walk through the hall with a paper in my hand and say I am
going to the office and I can't stop for too long.  Before, I would
find myself chatting for an hour or an hour and a half.  So I had to
be aware of my hidden time sinks.  Another one is receptions.  When I
would go to receptions I noticed that I would stay a little bit longer
and chit chat --Laughter---.  So I limit the number of receptions I
attend --Laughter---. <P>

Lastly, take time for yourself.  One thing that I enjoy doing is
working out. So one thing that I don't sacrifice is going to the Gym.
No matter what I am doing a lot of times I'll just leave things, and go
to the Gym.  Generally, when I return I feel a lot better and more
relaxed about what I am doing.  And so as Fran said, be sure to have a
real life and have time for yourself.  That's it. -----APPLAUSE,
APPLAUSE, APPLAUSE. <P>

Now I think Jan is going to teach us something about time management
later on --- Laughter--.  I don't think there is any time for
questions but we are all going to be around all day and are happy to
answer any questions you have. Thanks a lot, panel. <P>


<DT> <B>Cynthia Brown</B>

Thanks to the whole panel. Now we all need a little break so there are
coffee and muffins at the back of the room. We should have at least 15
minutes so we will start up again at 10:35.
