PROGRAMS OF STUDY:
The College of Computing currently offers programs of study leading to the
degrees of Doctor of Philosophy and Master of Science in computer science. 
The College also offers an interdisciplinary program leading to the degree
of Doctor of Philosophy in algorithms, combinatorics, and optimization.  In
addition, the college awards an interdisciplinary Ph.D. certificate in
cognitive science.  The principal requirements for the Ph.D. are successful
completion of certain comprehensive examinations and submission of a
dissertation that describes achievement in research and is intended for
people who intend to pursue research careers.  A student may earn the M.S.
degree by completing either 50 quarter hours of approved course work or 33
hours of approved course work and a thesis.  The master's degree is intended
for people who have a variety of career objectives, including technical and
managerial positions in industry and government.  A wide variety of graduate
courses and research seminars are offered, and several active colloquium
series featuring outside speakers are held.

AREAS OF RESEARCH:
The areas of research at the College of Computing are artificial
intelligence, architecture, cognitive science, database and information
systems, graphics and visualization, human computer interaction, networking
and telecommunications, performance analysis, programming languages and
compilers, software engineering, systems (including operating systems,
distributed systems, parallel systems, and real-time systems), and theory
(including complexity and automata theory and the ACO program).

RESEARCH FACILITIES:
The College maintains a variety of computer systems in support of its
academic and research activities. These include a 10-node Sequent Symmetry
S27, Sun and Hewlett-Packard systems used as file and compute servers, four
of which are quad-processor machines, an Epoch file server with a read-write
optical library unit, more than 200 workstation class machines from Sun,
Digital, NeXT, Hewlett-Packard, Silicon Graphics, and IBM, as well as
numerous smaller systems and over 100 X terminals.

In addition to general-purpose computing facilities, the College has many
specialized systems. The College's Graphics, Visualization, and Usability
(GVU) Center houses a variety of graphics and multimedia equipment,
including high-performance systems from Silicon Graphics, Pixar, Sun,
Digital, Apple, and Intel, as well as extensive video and audio facilities
for recording and editing.  A Scientific Visualization Laboratory with
additional equipment from Digital and Silicon Graphics is jointly operated
by the GVU Center and the Institute's Office of Information Technology
(OIT). The High-Performance and Parallel Computation Experimentation
Laboratory (HPPCEL), another joint operation between the College and OIT,
serves as a focus for interdisciplinary research involving high-performance
computer systems. Shared facilities include a Kendall Square Research KSR1
with 32 superscalar RISC processors, a Cray Y/MP-EL dual-processor
supercomputer, a 32-node BBN Butterfly GP1000, and a laboratory of IBM, Sun,
and SGI workstations. A 16-node Intel iPSC/2 and a 1,024-node MASPAR MP-2
SIMD multiprocessor are jointly operated with the School of Electrical
Engineering, along with a laboratory of Hewlett-Packard workstations.
Artificial intelligence activities are supported by Symbolics LISP,
Mac/Ivory, and Sun/Ivory systems, and a laboratory of IBM RS/6000
workstations. Other specialized laboratories support research in computer
networking and communications systems, distributed computing, databases,
robotics, and software engineering.

All of the College's facilities are connected via local area networks which
are in turn linked to a campus-wide network, providing access to systems
throughout the Georgia Tech community. As a NSFNET and SURAnet backbone
site, the campus networking facilities provide a direct connection to the
Internet, offering a means of high-speed communication with the scientific
community worldwide.

Additional computing facilities are provided to the Georgia Tech campus by
the Institute's Office of Information Technology (OIT), including several
public-access clusters of Apple, Digital, IBM, NeXT, and Sun workstations, a
Sun SPARCcenter 2000 with 6 superscalar RISC processors, a 16-node Sequent
Symmetry S81, CDC Cyber 990 and IBM ES9000 mainframes, and public-access
interactive terminals. All are connected to the campus network, which
provides direct communication with the Internet, as well as BITNET and
Usenet.

FINANCIAL AID
Most doctoral students and some master's students are supported throughout
the year by assistantships.  Research assistants participate in the
College's ongoing research projects.  The range of teaching assistants'
duties includes grading, instructional laboratory support, and some
teaching.  The full-time base pay for assistants ranged from $29,000 to
$31,000 per fiscal year in 1992-93.  Assistantships are usually awarded on a
one-third-time basis at a corresponding fraction of the full-time base pay,
plus the cost of reduced tuition and fees.  Some tuition waivers are
available.  A limited number of fellowships are available, as well as an
industry-college cooperative program.  In addition, Georgia Tech President's
Fellowships at $4,000 per calendar year are available as supplements to
normal assistantships or fellowship awards.

LIVING AND HOUSING COSTS
The Housing Office supervises 3,550 single spaces and 300 married student
apartments.  In 1992-93, room rent cost $850-$950 per quarter and board,
$750-$800 per quarter.  The total expense for a single student living on
campus, excluding tuition and fees, is estimated to be $2600-$2700 per
quarter.

ENROLLMENT
The Georgia Institute of Technology has a total enrollment of about 12,000
students, of whom approximately 3,000 are graduate students.  The College's
graduate enrollment exceeds 200.

LOCATION
Situated close to the center of Atlanta on a 330-acre campus, Georgia Tech
is near the many cultural and sports activities of the city.  Atlanta, the
site of the 1996 Olympic Games, is the headquarters of many large corporations 
and is the financial hub of the rapidly growing southeastern United States.

THE INSTITUTE
The Georgia Institute of Technology was founded in 1885.  It offers graduate
and undergraduate degrees in computing, the sciences, and engineering.  As
the site of the Olympic Village for the 1996 Olympic Games, Georgia Tech
will host competitive events and serve as a source of technical and human
resources.

APPLYING
Students with a variety of backgrounds are encouraged to apply, provided
they have a strong computer science and mathematics preparation.  All
applicants must submit GRE scores on the General Test and the Subject Test
in computer science.  All international students from countries in which
English is not the native language must submit their results from TOEFL. 
For Ph.D. applicants, completed applications for fall quarter should be
received by February 1. For M.S. applicants, by June 1.
