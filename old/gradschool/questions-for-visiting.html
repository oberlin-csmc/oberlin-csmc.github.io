<H1>Questions to ask when visiting schools</H1>

A question to ask anyone and everyone:<BR>
Is some question I should be asking that I haven't asked yet?

<H2>Questions to ask Students</H2>

<H3>About the school and the advisor:</H3>
<OL>
<LI> Why did you decide to come here?
<LI> Do you like it here?
<LI> Do you think that most of the students here like it?
<LI> What is the best thing about going to grad school here?  The
   worst? (if they have to think about the worst then its pretty
   good... if EVERYONE there gives the same answer, you pretty
   much know...)  
<LI> What most surprised you about this program when you
   arrived here? 
<LI> What's the average size of a class?
<LI> How large was your first-year class?  How many of them are
   still here? 
<LI> Tell me about the program; are there clear and concrete
   expectations established for student performance? (read the
   brochure first to see if the brochure matches with what
   they say). 
<LI> What's the qualification system like? Is it fair?
<LI> What is the minor thing mentioned in the brochure? 
<LI> How do you refer to your profs? (Dr foo, Prof foo, Mr foo,
   foo, Bob, or Hey You!, pumpkin, Duck face... this sort of
   thing... )  
<LI> How many people do you share an office with? Howbout
   non-first years? 
<LI> How much do students learn from eachother? Are they
   encouraged to learn from eachother?
<LI> How well do students work together
<LI> Whats the emphasis between theory and applications?
<LI> Is there lots of cross-disciplinary stuff?
</OL>

<H3>About advisors:</H3>
<OL>
<LI> Do you like your advisor?
<LI> What would you like to see your advisor do differently?
<LI> What is the best thing about your advisor?  The worst?
<LI> Does (my prospective) advisor tell you, advise you, ignore you?
<LI> How long does it generally take students to get their Phds 
   under your advisor? in general?
</OL>

<H3>About the assistantship: </H3>
<OL>
<LI> What is the department's track record on funding students
   after their first year, and what is your advisor's track
   record in particular? (That is, is it reasonable for you to
   expect that your stipend will be continued until you
   graduate?) (I suggest you ask this question of both
   students and prospective advisor.  The faculty will almost
   certainly tell you that they can't guarantee anything,
   which is true. The students may be able to give you a feel
   for how secure or insecure they feel about their funding
   and whether there are horror stories of people getting
   dropped despite good work.)
<LI> What's a normal load for TAs?
<LI> Are the undergrads smart or not?
<LI> How much slave labor is there?
</OL>

<H3>About living: </H3>
<OL>
<LI> Does your stipend adequately cover living costs in this city
<LI> How are the restaurants
<LI> What's the cost of living? How does it relate to safety of living?
<LI> Are there other safety issues?
<LI> Is slip easy/cheap?
<LI> &lt;Insert hobbie here&gt;: can I pursue them?
</OL>

<H3>About research groups:</H3>
<OL>
<LI> How much communication and collaboration is there between
   different research groups?
<LI> What's the average size of a research group?
<LI> Are students in your prospective research group encouraged
   to work together and help one another learn the ropes?  Do
   they? (and consider whether the students you talk to seem
   helpful and approachable.  Older students are an important
   source of encouragement and information.  You don't want to
   be running to your advisor for every little thing, after all.) 
</OL>

<H3>About the computer facilities:</H3>
<OL>
<LI> Do you use VMS or UNIX? 
<LI> Is the department stingy with computer resources?
<LI> Is there a quota? Are there other restrictions 
<LI> Is the software up-to-date? (emacs, gcc -- 2.6.3)
<LI> Whats the sysadmin like?
</OL>

<H3>About the summer:</H3>
<OL>
<LI> Does the school have connections with companies. (ie in
   research or summer jobs).  
<LI> Does the school support its students in the summer?
</OL>

<H3>About the students:</H3>
<OL>
<LI> How conservative is the student body?
<LI> Do frats (and beer parties) dominate the campus
<LI> Social life? What's it like? Do grads interact with the
   college community? 
<LI> (are they smart?)
</OL>

<H2>To ask people in the know:</H2>

<OL>
<LI> How many people do students usually share an office with? Howbout
   non-first years?
<LI> Do I get health insurance? What does the health insurance cover and
   how much does it cost? Is coverage available for dependents
   and how much does it cost? 
<LI> How many years is my aid guarranteed for if I remain in good
   standing? What's your defenition of "in good standing"? 
<LI> How many (PhD) students does this department plan to admist this
    year?  Is the a typical number?  (Be a little concerned if the
    number is significantly larger than in past years.  Growing
    pains hurt.) 
<LI> Is there a "physical sciences" brochure?
</OL>

<H2>To ask prospective advisors:</H2>

<OL> 
<LI> I am of course familiar with the papers you suggested I read
and with work of yours that has been published -- and you *will* be,
won't you? :-) -- you usually can find <EM>lots</EM> of stuff in
technical reports available from the schools www server. Where do you
see your research heading in the next 5 years i.e., during my tenure
as a grad student?  (Discuss the response in terms of your own goals
and interests.  Pay close attention to how they treat your comments.
Sure, your ideas are very wet-behind-the-ears at this point, but do
they listen and make constructive, guiding comments that help you to
understand your own ideas better, or do you feel squashed or
overwhelmed?  Does this work sound exciting?  If you like, you might
also ask whether they anticipate this area being well-funded and
growing, that is, whether this will be a good area for someone in your
position to be moving into.)
<LI> Where is your research currently going?
<LI> What do you expect of your grad students, over and above the
departmental expectations?  How long do your PhD students typically
take to complete their degrees?
<LI> Are you in fact accepting new students at this time?  Is it
realistic for me to hope to be one of them, after a reasonable period
for you to get to know me and my work?
<LI> How many students -- MS and PhD -- do you currently supervise?  Is
this a typical number for you?  How often do you meet with your
students?  How many classes do you teach per year?
<LI> Are your students funded through your research grants, or are they
funded through departmental funds, e.g. as teaching assistants?  (You
can ask this question less bluntly by phrasing it in terms of a request
to explain how PhD student funding works around here.  If they answer
in departmental terms, you can follow up with an innocent "so all of
your PhD students are funded from your research grants?" to probe their
particular track record.)
<LI> Do you anticipate taking a sabbatical or retiring in the next five
years?
<LI> How many students of yours have completed their PhDs?  How long
does it generaly take them to complete their PhDs?  (Note: for a new
prof, zero may be an acceptable answer.  If the answer is zero or a
small number, however, realize that you may be dealing with an
inexperienced advisor and may therefore want to pay a little more
attention to older students and non-advisor faculty that may be able
to serve as additional sources of information and guidance.)
<LI> Do your students tend to move into industry or Academia?  Where are
some of your former students now? (this isn't a right-or-wrong sort of
question.  The point for you is to understand where this line of
research is most likely to take you and to consider how that meshes
with your personal goals.)
</OL>


Many thanks to Ian Robertson, Karen Ward, Brian Postow, Megan Schulte,
and everyone else who helped me make this list of questions as
comprehensive as possible :).
