    student population, tuition, private vs. public, etc., check the following
    (address given by Paul Eykamp (peykamp@weber.ucsd.edu) :

The <A HREF="gopher://gopher.ed.gov/11/programs">Department of
Education</A> has all the information that there is (more or less) at:
//gopher.ed.gov/11/programs if you have mosaic. <P>

I suppose that the regular gopher address is

Nearly all the information that the Dept of Education collects is
there, you need SAS or SYSTAT to access most of it.
