What follows was a humourous reply to some poor sole's question about answering
an application form for an MBA. I could not find the name of the author of such
ingenious replies, so if you're around, send me your name and I'll include it
here ! <P>

<B>
	I am applying to a few grad schools for September '94.  Since all these
schools require at least two essays each, I was wondering if anyone out there
has any *generic* ideas of what to write on the following topics: <P>

1.  Why do I want to do an MBA.  How will an MBA help me. </B> <P>

I wanna do an MBA cause I herd dey make the big bucks and cause you don't
have to take real hard stuff like physics or differential equations and
cause it would make my daddy real proud like. <P>

<B>2.  How do I perform in a team.</B> <P>

I'm good on a team. I not only want to do an MBA but would be willing
to do lunch or even do some secretaries if dey were cute. <P>

<B>3.  Any non-professional important activity...why?</B> <P>

No. Only business is important to me. I'm an A+ type. Work work work all
day. But I could learn to play golf if that would help but it would be
strictly for professional purposes though I don't mean I would be a 
pro golfer you know. <P>

<B>	Once again, I want <EM>generic</EM> ideas.  I have a few funny
ideas.  Does anybody recommend such a line of thought?  If you have
any suggestions, reach out.  I will post a summary by the end of
January. <P> 

	<EM>Anything</EM> and <EM>everything goes.  All</EM> ideas
	will be appriciated.
