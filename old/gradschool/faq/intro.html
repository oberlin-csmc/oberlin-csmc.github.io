<H1>Introduction to soc.college.grad/gradinfo</H1>

   Both soc.college.grad and soc.college.gradinfo are unmoderated
newsgroups (hereafter called .grad and .gradinfo respectively). 
The original intent was to make .grad a place for grad-related
discussions, and .gradinfo a place to post brochure-type 
articles.  However, this distinction has not been observed
in the past; many people crossposted articles to both 
groups.  It has been suggested that people add the word "INFO:"
to their subject lines when they are posting informational articles 
in .grad or University brochures.    <P>
   Articles submitted to the groups should follow USENET unofficial
guidelines (i.e. thou shalt not write more than 70 characters
per line, thou shalt trim off as much quoted messages as possible,
etc.)  Please refer to news.newusers.questions and news.answers.   <P>
