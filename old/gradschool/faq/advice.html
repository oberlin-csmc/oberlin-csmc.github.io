<H1>General Questions &amp; Advice About Grad School</H1>

General Advice about Grad schools (Dick Adams (rdadams@ubmail.ubalt.edu) : <P>

The five critical factors of initial academic employment are 
<OL>
<LI>  the demand in the marketplace, 
<LI>  where your Ph.D. is from,
<LI>  who is your adviser/dissertation chair,
<LI>  the quality of your dissertation, and
<LI>  the quality of your pre-Ph.D. publications.
</OL>

You need to assess the long-term demand in the marketplace and
you need to update that assessment on a periodic basis of no
less than annually. <P>

Although you are already dealing with the second issue, you need
to strongly consider who your advisor will be.  This will set
the stage for your dissertation topic - so you should carefully
consider the academic productivity of potential advisers.  You
should also meet these people beforehand and rap with their
graduate students.  A good adviser is invaluable in finding your
initial academic position.  I have seen Ph.D.'s with exceptionally
weak presentation skills get appointments in good schools because
of the influence of their adviser. <P>

A quality dissertation means well-written, new contribution to 
the literature, and readily divisible into journal articles.  
Anyone with a definable potential for four journal articles 
in their first three-year appointment should make it to the
final interview for any position. <P>

Finally, blessed are they who publish before their dissertation 
defense - for their defense committee shall have refereed evidence
of dissertation quality and academic potential, and they shall 
have created pre-employment standing in the marketplace. <P>

<B>Q: What's Grad School like ?</B> <P>

From: jparches@acpub.duke.edu (Jennifer Parchesky)<BR>
I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing for people entering or applying
for grad school to hear about the down side, and especially not about the
current job market situation in academia.  I have a lot of friends from
college who are contemplating grad school just because a) they're having a
hard time finding jobs with a BA, b) they miss the college environment, or
c) they can't figure out what else to do.  I tell them DON'T DO IT!!!!!
If a well-paid job is all you're interested in, spending 6 years working your
way up the corporate ladder will probably serve you much better. <P>

So, a little advice: 
<UL>
<LI> Grad school is not like college.  You will not be surrounded by friends and
fun and have loads of leisure time (unless you are completely blowing off
your work, in which case you will not be in grad school for long).  For the
most part, you will spend a lot of time alone, you will have to set your
own goals and your own schedule with nobody holding your hand, and you will
spend most of your time working (the boundaries between work and leisure
tend to dissolve when you spend your nights and weekends reading or 
researching.)
<LI> During this period, you will be broke all the time.  Most strong programs
will give their strongest applicants fellowships or assistantships ranging
from  $7000 to $15,000 (with the big bucks mostly only going to scientists).
This is not a lot of money to live on, but you can survive (with maybe a few
loans or outside employment if you're at the low end of the scale.)  
If your PhD program does not offer you funding,
you need to *seriously* question whether to accept, because it means either
a) your department is really poor, which could lead to lots of other problems
down the road, b) you are not one of the stronger applicants, in which case
you may be a weak applicant on the job market as well, or c) they want to
get people to pay for the first year or two and then weed most of them out.
If you are not independently wealthy, you need to decide how much debt you're
willing to go into, given that you might not get a job with your degree.  Or
spend another year working and studying and reapply the following year.
<LI> Academic positions are scarce and highly competitive, especially in 
literature and other humanities.  You may do all that work and not get a
position as a professor.  (On the other hand, you can still get a job doing
something else, but it's likely to be something you could have gotten with
a bachelor's or master's degree.)
<LI> The only good reasons for going to grad school, at least in the humanities,
are that you love doing research in your field, love teaching, and are
committed enough to wanting to be an academic that you're willing to risk
a large chunk of your life trying to become one.  IMHO, of course.  Given
the current job market, it really hacks me off to have the field cluttered
up with people who would be far happier doing something else.
</UL>

Good things about grad school:
<UL>
<LI> No one thinks you're weird if you read all the time.
<LI> You can set your own goals and  schedule most of the time.
<LI> You get free internet access.
<LI> If you do love research and teaching, you will be doing it as much as you 
could possibly want to.
</UL>

I don't want to scare away people who are really sure they want to be in
graduate school, but I know a lot of people who could have saved themselves
several years of unhappiness and a heck of a lot of money if they had had
a more realistic idea of what they were getting themselves into.  

<HR>
An alternative view : <P>

From: clin@eng.umd.edu (Charles Lin) <P>

    I've seen it other ways.   Some grad students do have fun, but
spend a few days where they concentrate on their work and crank out results.
There are people I know who do nothing for two or three weeks but play
games, and then work hard for one week programming.   And, this is grad
school.   Of course, you need a sympathetic advisor who will let you
do this.   In addition, it may mean you will take a long time graduating. <P>

   In addition, some students who are in technical areas can sometimes
get summer jobs that pay better (assuming the advisor will let you go)
such as working at Bell Labs, etc.   In general, however, you will not be
making a fortune unless you earn the degree part time (again, only
with advisor consent).   If you do your Ph.D. part time, then it
will take a really long time, but then you won't be so poor either
assuming you have a full time job that pays decent. I don't know how 
common this is, but it does happen.   Most Ph.D. candidates are full 
time though. <P>

<HR>
<HR>
<B>Q: Wat is a credit hour ?</B> <P>

Charles Lin (clin@eng.umd.edu) explains :<BR>
   A credit hour is a way of weighting the grades that you get for a
course. For example, in a 4 point grading system (A = 4 pts,B = 3 pts,
etc.), if you take a three credit course and get a B, and then take a
4 credit course, and get an A, then your GPA is the grade you get,
multiplied by the credit hours for that course, divided by total
credit hours. <P>

<KBD>( (3 credits * 3.0) + (4 credits * 4.0) ) / 7 credits = GPA</KBD> <P>

    This would be the GPA if you only had those two courses. Most
universities have courses that weigh somewhere between 3 and 4 credit
hours. Usually the more credit hours that is required per course, the
more work it is, or the harder it is. However, there is no
standard. Most courses at the University of Maryland are 3 credit
hours each. However, at Cornell University, many of the introductory
courses are 3 credits, but many of the technical upper-level (junior
and senior undergraduate courses as well as grad courses) are 4
credits. <P>

   Other universities use such terms as units. You can get a rough idea of what
you need to graduate by taking the total number of credit hours needed to 
graduate and divide it by a typical course number of credits. SO, 55 credit 
hours divided by about 4 credits per course, would be 13 or 14 courses, which,
at the grad level is about 4 semesters worth of courses or five semesters 
(average of 3 courses a semester). <P>

<HR>
Some additional comments by Chris Parks about the same subject; <P>

Credit hours are away of measuring the time spent in a course--time spent 
in lecture, discussion sections, lab sessions, etc. <P>

Ideally, 1 credit hour refers to one hour per week during the length of 
the quarter, trimester, or semester.  In reality, there is a lot of 
variation.  Some 1 credit courses may meet for more than one hour a 
week.  Science courses with labwork often meet for more hours than the 
credits awarded--I remember a very intensive 5 credit chemistry course 
where I did my undergraduate work that included 3 hours of lecture, 2 
hours of discussion section, and 8 hours a week of labwork: 13 hours a 
week (to say nothing of time spent working on homework) for 5 credit 
hours. (Needless to say, I didn't take that course.) This sort of 
workload is, thankfully, pretty rare.  Most schools that assign credit hour
values stay pretty close to 1 hour/week = 1 credit. <P>

Also, it is not unusual for a university to have class periods that are less
than an hour in length, and the length of the quarter/trimester/semester
varies from school to school.  <P>

A final note:  a credit earned at a school on the quarter system is not 
equal to a credit earned on the semester system, since a quarter is 
shorter (10-12 weeks for a quarter, vs. 15-17 weeks for a semester 
is typical).  The usual equivalency is that 1 quarter credit = 2/3 of a 
semester hour.  So a degree program which requires 45 quarter credits to 
complete is comparable to a program which requires 30 semester credits to 
complete. <P>

<HR>
<HR>
<B>Q:What do admissions officers consider more important :
<UL>
<LI> 	i) GRE scores or
<LI> 	ii) undergraduate academic record?
</UL>
</B>

The answer to your question will depend upon the program(s) and 
institution(s) to which you apply.  Speaking for the University at which 
I work, some of our programs do not require GRE scores at all, so they 
are going to evaluate you almost exclusively on gradepoint.  When a 
program here does require GREs, it may or may not place equal weight on 
the scores and the gradepoint. <P>

The Educational Testing Service (ETS), which owns and administers the 
GRE, is very particular about how scores are used in the admissions process.  
ETS strongly discourages the use of cut-offs:  saying "if you have a GRE 
score of at least 550 in the verbal measure, you will be admitted, but 
not if you have only a 540" would be considered to be a poor usage of the 
GRE by ETS. <P>

The reason for the variation is that there is no overall government or 
private agency in the USA which mandates admission policy.  Each college 
or university has substantial freedom to set its own standards. <P>

Unfortunately, the best (and really the only way) to determine what kind 
of weight is placed on GPA and on the GRE is to ask the people at the 
colleges or universities you are interested in attending.  If you are 
attending a college or university which does not use a similar grade 
scale to the scales used by US universities, you should ask how the 
colleges you are interested view the grades you have earned.  You might 
want to phrase the question: "What GPA (and/or test scores) does the 
typical admitted applicant to your college have?" <P>

This newsgroup is a good place to ask questions about particular 
institutions.  If you were to post a request along the lines of
"I am interested in attending {institution name}.  Can anyone tell me 
what kind of gradepoint average is needed to get in?", you may get some 
responses from students at that institution, or from people who work 
there (like me). <P>

<B>Q: I have heard that the top 5 basically require a 4.000 no questions
asked....is this true? what about the second 5?</B> <P>

  
From: clin@eng.umd.edu (Charles Lin)<BR>
 Not from what I have heard.   It is certainly preferable
to have your GPA around 3.6 or higher, but having a 4.0 doesn't
guarantee you will get into a name school, and having a 3.0 doesn't
necessarily exclude you, though you really have to have something
else that stands out like outstanding recommendations, and
showing that you have some skill that some professor might
want.   For example, if you happen to be really good at theory
but lousy at programming, and have written or co-written
papers, then this would count for something.   I think the
name schools want to see students who have done research
or who have recommendations that say they are unusually
bright.    <P>

    I think, first and foremost, the top 5 universities are
looking to see if you can handle graduate level courses.
Your undergrad grades contribute to this.   If you have
a 4.0, this is an indication that you are bright.   A
recommendation saying that you are a brilliant student
may also help.    The second is potential for doing
research.   If you have done some research already, then
this looks good, especially if it is somewhat noteworthy
research.   If you have skills, such as being able to
write large amounts of code, say, systems coding, or stuff
like that, then these skills may help.   If your research
meshes well with what's being done, then that may also
help.   Any interesting experiences that you have that
might tie in with someone's research can help offset
a GPA that isn't near 4.0.   I think once you are past
a GPA of 3.5 or so, then that's what people are looking
for.   Do you have exceptional talent in some area?
The higher the GPA, probably, the less they care if
you have talent in a specific area, and may accept you
for simply being bright. <P>

    The top schools can basically look for students
who have the highest GPA, the highest GREs, and the
best recommendations, and probably not go wrong there.
However, the lower your GPA, the more you have to sell
yourself.   For example, I think there are many researchers
who may not be doing the most inventive research in
the world, or profound, but they know how to sell their
research and convince others that their research is
quite good.   So, a very bright student with high grades
doesn't need to do much except apply.   A student with
a lower GPA may have to visit the university, talk with
the faculty, and do various other things to try to
convince them that you are worth being accepted.   However,
if all you have done is taken classes, and have a so-so
GPA, then you don't have much to sell.   If, on the
other hand, you built your own parallel processor and
a compiler to go with it, and your GPA is 3.2, then you
are going to get more attention. <P>

<B>
also, does anyone know what kind of impact things like minority status
have on acceptance rates (american indian, for example)...
</B> <P>

     Universities try to make an effort to accept minorities
(historically disadvantaged minorities) and may be willing
to lower their standards just a tad to let some in.   However,
I don't think it will be a big lowering.   Certainly, the
minorities that are let in ought to be able to handle the
grad work.   However, so few minorities (even non-minorities)
apply to grad school, that the numbers are small, in any
case.   Asian Americans (Indian, Chinese, Korean, etc.) tend
to number a bit more than other minorities.   Women are
also encouraged to apply, but again, very few get in
because so few apply.


<HR>
<HR>

<B>Q: While recently looking over the admissions packet for 
(named University), I noticed that they require 2 GPA's to be 
calculated. The first is the normal, cumulative one, and the 
second is made up only of classes taken in the last two 
years. Is this a common practice among grad schools?
Which GPA is more important? Which should be emphasized?
</B> <P>

Chris Parks : <P>

Where I work, we look at the last-two-years primarily for applicants 
whose cumulative GPAs are below 3.0. One rationale for doing a GPA on the 
last two years is that most juniors and seniors are focussing on their majors 
in that period.  To the extent that assumption is true, a last-two-years 
GPA becomes an indication of an applicants capability within their chosen 
discipline.  In addition to these measures, sometimes a GPA on courses 
strictly within the major is calculated. <P>

Given the nature of graduate study, it is important not only to know that 
a given applicant has the basic capacity to do advanced study (cumulative 
GPA), but to know that s/he has adequite preparation in the field (or in 
related fields-- last-two-years GPA).   <P>

<B>Q: How would I choose an advisor ?</B> <P>

From: jeanne@lamar.ColoState.EDU (Jeanne Sirovatka) <P>

My two cents are that your first priority needs to be how interested
you are in doing the research.  This is going to be your life for the
next few years, so you better like it!  However, a close second priority
is your potential compatibility with your advisor.  It doesn't do any good to 
work for a professor that you don't enjoy interacting with. <P>

As far as tenured vs. non-tenured professors go, I'd say that would
be a bit farther down on the list of things to consider.  If you're 
convinced that the research is top-notch, then I wouldn't worry <too
much> about the advisor's age, etc. <P>

<HR>
An additional view by Chris Parks :<BR>
It is common for graduate degree programs to admit students on the 
basis of whether an advisor is available.  The real question is, "What 
advisor-advisee ratio is appropriate?"  Where I work we have programs 
that will admit only a dozen or less new students each fall because they 
have decided to keep the ratio low.  This makes the admissions process 
for those programs very competitive. <P>

Another related issue is whether or not the faculty who are free to take 
on new students are matched with prospective students in terms of 
research interests.  If you want to study medieval literature, and a 
program to which you are applying doesn't have any faculty who could take on
a new student, you aren't going to get admitted to that program...at
least not now.  <P>

<HR>
<HR>
<B>
Q: In almost all grad catalogs that I have received I see 3.0/4 points as the 
minimum requirement for grad school. Does my (GPA<3.0) mean that I should 
NOT even consider grad school?
</B> <P>

From clin@eng.umd.edu (Charles C. Lin)  <P>

Once you have a GPA below 3.0, it gets very hard to get into
grad school, unless you have something else that you can offer.
I know of someone who has a GPA below 3.0 and was still able
to get into grad school, but had to talk to professors at
the various universities, and try to get them interested
in his background.   Basically, he had done some research
as an undergrad, and was able to use that as a selling point.
With a low GPA, you have to pull every string you know to
apply to grad school.   I would say that it would be near
impossible to get into a grad school in the top ten universities,
but it might be possible to get into a grad school with
lower rankings, provided you have something else that
stands out in terms of your background. <P>

    There are other options.   For example, you might be able
to take graduate level courses, but not be officially enrolled
as an MS or Ph.D. student.   If you get A's in these courses,
that might convince an admissions committee later on. <P>

<HR>
Another more detailed answer by kcsite@leland.Stanford.EDU (Kyle Coachman) <P>

I have talked to a couple professors about the grad school admission
process and am under the impression that almost any single weakness
in one's record, including bad grades, can be overcome if you have
strengths that can cancel them out. <P>

One prof gave me the example of a student with a 2.5 GPA that
got into Stanford Biology program (a top school) a couple of years
ago.  She said his strengths were that he had strong research credentials,
excellent GRE scores, worked throughout his college years, and went
to one of the better schools in the country as an undergrad. <P>

Apparently, I am told, grades are not necessarily a very good indicator
of how one will perform as a researcher, so if you are going into a
scientific field (I don't know much about non-scientific fields),
you are definitely not out of the race... <P>


...but you should probably work hard on writing a good personal statement,
   which will need to cover these points: <P>

<UL>
<LI> 
you should be able to explain why your grades were not spectacular as an
 undergrad and why you will be a much better grad student, for example did
 you have to work, or did you have a family tragedy, or did it take
 you awhile to find you focus, confidence, or study skills.  Almost any
 reason can help you if you set it up right.

<LI> 
you should make it clear that you know alot about the school and the program
 to which you are applying, for example mention some of the professors there
 and say why you think what they are doing is v-e-e-e-ery interesting.

<LI> 
you should be able to explain why you want to go to grad school, and it
 should be a relatively compelling reason.  "I want more money", "A Ph.D.
 is more prestigious", or "There are no jobs for bachelor's degrees" will
 NOT help you here.
</UL>

also...

<UL>
<LI> a couple very good recommendations go a l-o-o-o-o-ong way
<LI> good GRE score are pretty important
</UL>

<HR>
<HR>
<B>Q: What is the nature of a PhD ?</B> <P>

 Chris Parks :<BR>
If I am understanding your question, you are asking which of these views 
constitutes the dominant view of what would be considered an appropriate 
topic for research leading to a doctoral dissertation. <P>

The answer is "Yes."  Academic departments are highly individual things.  
Even within a particular discipline, you will probably notice philosophical 
differences between departments at two different universities.  One of 
the possible differences could easily be whether you would be allowed to 
expand upon an existing theory or would be required to develop something 
entirely new.  Usually these sorts of requirements are set by the 
department rather than by any particular university standard.  Since your 
department eventually has to say "This work merits the awarding of a 
doctorate", it is the members of the department who will determine when 
you've done enough (or the right sort of work).  <P>

My guess is that the main person in charge is your advisor.  Since 
you are working under her/his supervision, s/he has the final say.  My 
oldest brother had to do a great deal of work before his advisor was 
satisfied with my brother's dissertation.  Once the advisor was 
satisfied, then my brother knew he was essentially done. <P>

Those of you out there who are actually in doctoral programs should feel 
free to chime in with your own experiences :)  <P>

<HR>
<HR>
<B>Q: Could I have more info about recommendations ?
</B> <P>

From the NAGPS Guide to Graduate Students : <P>

Admissions committees expect recommendations to support and reinforce
the rest of the application. They act as a sort of reality check. When
the information from your recommendor doesnt match up with the
information youve provided, it looks bad. <P>

Great recommendations are rarely enough to save a weak application from
doom. But they might push a borderline case over to the admit pile. <P>

Mediocre recommendations are potentially harmful: an application that is
strong in all other areas now has an inconsistency that's hard to
ignore. <P>

Bad recommendations meaning that negative information is provided cast
doubt on the picture youve created. In some cases they invalidate your
claims. This can mean the end for your application. Again, be careful
whom you ask for recommendations. <P>

<HR>
<HR>
<B>Q: Do you think it is polite to ask the recommender (when asking for a
recommendation letter) if he/she could give a good recommendation?
</B> <P>

You certainly want to be polite when you ask someone such a question.  
But you certainly should ask.  Otherwise, the programs you apply to will 
get vague or even negative letters, which certainly won't help your 
chances of getting admitted. <P>

</PRE>

<HR>
From: clin@eng.umd.edu (Charles Lin)<BR>
   It would be more polite to ask if they feel they can give a good
recommendation rather that if they will give one. <P>

<HR>
<HR>
<B>Q: Charles Barnard asks:<BR>
If I am applying to a clinical psych program and
need recomendations, Is it appropriate to ask an English professor
for one?<BR></B>
and<BR> 
<B>I'm sweating over who to ask for references.
How well do you have to know a professor in order to get
a good recomendation? Is being in a seminar enough?
Is it appropriate to ask a professor at this late date to spend some time
and get to know me just for a recomendation?</B> <P>

(by Chris Parks again) <P>

This depends on the requirements that the programs to which you 
apply have for recommendations. <P>

If a program requires that the recommender be able to comment on your
ability in the field of psychology, you will need to ask someone who has
had you in a psych course to write the letter.  If the program only asks
that the recommender be able to comment on your general capability for
graduate study, an instructor in any field will do.   <P>

It certainly helps if the person who is writing your letter knows you as
something more than as "one of several students in course X".  So if you
have taken more than one course with a professor, worked with a professor
on an independant study course, assisted with her/his research, or even
distinguished yourself by the quality of your work within a class, you are
more likely to get a specific recommendation.  <P>

<HR>
<HR>
Some Questions answered by Chris Parks : <P>

<B>Q:I am currently taking a double major degree, but I have decided
to do graduate study concentration on only one of the majors.  Are 
graduate schools more interested in the total GPA, or the GPA of the
relevant major?</B> <P>

A: It will depend upon the school.  Both GPAs will count:  overall GPA as an 
indication of overall capacity for advanced study, and subject GPA as an 
indication of capacity to study in the field, and as an indication of 
adequite preparation in the discipline.  The amount of weight these 
measures receive depends on the particular schools to which you will apply.  <P>

<B>Q: I am just wondering why the number of credits toward Master Degree vary
between schools. Some universities require 48-72 and others require 24-36 to 
apply toward the degree in semester system. <P>
</B>

A: There are several reasons for such variation.  Professionally-oriented 
programs may require more credits than the traditional academic 
programs.  At UWM (where I work), many of the programs in our College of 
Letters in Science require around 24 semester credits. In contrast, our 
Business master's programs require around 30 credits, our Library and 
Information Science and Nursing programs each require 36 credits, our MPA 
program requires 42 credits, and our MFA program in Performing Arts-Theater 
requires 72 credits. <P>

<B>Q:But the schools that require more credit hours still have the same length of
study(2 year program). Does it mean they are harder because you take more
credit hours unless you want to finish it slower, 3 or 4 years?
</B> <P>

A:Length of time to complete the degree depends upon whether part-time 
enrollment is allowed.  At a school with a large part-time enrollment, 
rather than setting a hard-and-fast policy (e.g. completion in two 
years), they may decide to be more flexible (e.g. at UWM, completion of all 
requirements in five or seven years, depending upon the number of credits 
required). <P>

The only ways to finish a 40 credit masters in two years would be (a) to 
take a higher credit load each semester [compared to what someone in a 
24 credit masters has to take] or (b) to enroll in summer sessions as well. <P>

<B>Q: I'm beginning the process for applying to grad school. Does anyone have 
recommendations toward a format toward replying to opened ended 
essays (i.e., describe your experience in managing human, financial, 
material, etc... resources). I'm contemplating as to whether I should 
approach the question in an tabular format where I state each questions 
and give specific answers, or if I develop a theme in which I state 
examples of each, and than say why completion of the specific program would 
help.
</B> <P>

A: I would do drafts in both formats.  Each school you apply to may have
different requirements for the format of the statement of purpose/
admissions essay/whatever else they call it.  Some programs may require
tabular format, and others may want you to write an essay.  Once you are 
actually filling out applications for particular schools, you can revise 
your drafts to fit the format requirements and show where your skills 
and experience fit in with a particular schools program.  <P>

Abother advantage to doing drafts in both formats would be that the 
exercise might strengthen your final statements.  In writing for both 
formats, you may discover more effective ways to represent your 
capabilities for graduate study. <P>

A statement of purpose fills a variety of roles.  One of these roles is 
to make sure that your professional and/or research goals are in line 
with the interests of the faculty.  If you want to study international 
business and University X doesn't focus on that, you probably aren't 
going to get admitted. <P>

The statement is also used to evaluate your ability to write coherent prose.  <P>

A third possible use for the statement is to provide some background
information which goes beyond the specifically quantitative measures of
your admissibility (GPA, test scores).  This is particularly important if
your GPA and test scores are not as strong as those of other applicants in
the pool.  <P>

<B>Q: What will they usually do if an incomplete application form is sent, like
probably without the recommendation letters (although they will be sent later
on)?
Will they just look at the GPA, deciding that it's not really good and reject 
it right away, or will they table it for later evaluation? Or will they still 
consider the applicant, but without any financial aid?
</B> <P>

A: The answer is "Yes" :)  What I mean is, it depends on the program to 
which you are applying.  Some programs process admissions applications 
and applications for financial support at the same time; others don't.  
(It even varies with the individual programs where I work--some do, some 
don't.) <P>

In either case, my guess would be that most programs will wait a
reasonable period before doing anything to an incomplete application file. 
Usually, if a program decides to require recommendations or test scores,
it is because the faculty feel strongly that they need that information to
make a good decision, so they will wait for it.  Besides, it saves them
having to reconsider an application later on the basis of newly submitted
information.  Like most people with a lot to do, professors like to make 
decisions only once.  <P>

If all they get is an application and transcripts, and the required
letters of recommendation, and/or test scores don't arrive for months
afterward, they probably will decide the applicant is not seriously
considering their school and set the file aside, or refuse the applicant.  <P>

If a program *does* consider applicants for admission and financial
support at the same time, they *may* use the third option you mention, and
consider the applicant for admission only.  If you are depending on
financial support to afford tuition and living expenses, this option is
effectively the same as being refused.  <P>

The moral of the story is:  Ask the programs you are considering how long 
you have to get all your materials in.  If you are going to submit an 
incomplete application form, make sure you get the missing items in ASAP, 
and check periodically (not every day, but perhaps once a week) to see 
that the missing items are getting there. <P>
