   What Every Graduate Student Should Know About Financial Aid <P>

              by Joy Ward, Memphis State University <P>


     Welcome to the expensive world of graduate school!  Classes
are expensive, as are books.  Research can cost, especially if it
involves necessary travel.  You probably will not be automatically
covered by insurance, so plan on paying for a costly insurance
policy or facing the possibility of medical expenses.  Many
graduate schools are in expensive areas, such as New York, Boston,
or San Francisco so you can plan on paying hefty rents.  The list
goes on but I think you probably get the point by now.  Graduate
school is EXPENSIVE.  If you are not one of the lucky ones who has
an unlimited bank account you will probably need some kind of
financial aid while you are in graduate school.  Do not be
discouraged.  There is help available. <P>

<H2>What is Financial Aid? </H2>

     Financial aid is monetary assistance, from various sources,
that is available to students.  The vast majority of aid available
to graduate students in the United States is supplied by the
federal and state governments and the individual educational
institutions.  Other funds come from private donors.  But wherever
the funds come from, you as a graduate student have the right to
know as much as possible about how to apply for much needed aid. <P>

<H3>Eligibility</H3>

    Eligibility requirements vary widely depending on the source of
the funding and what the supplier/donor(s) is trying to accomplish
with the funding.  For example, federal programs established to assist
Native Americans in underrepresented areas, such as medicine, will
probably have as one of their prerequisites that the applicant be a
Native American.  Likewise, federal loan programs set up to encourage
citizens and non-citizen residents to attain higher degrees will have
in their requirements that the applicants be either US citizens or
that they have applied for citizenship.  On the other hand,
institutional graduate assistantships rarely have this sort of
requirement. <P>

      As you can see, eligibility requirements vary widely from
program to program.  Before applying for aid you will need to
ascertain your basic eligibility for each program that you wish to
utilize.  General eligibility requirements for most US government
sponsored programs that go through the campus financial aid office
usually include the following:

<OL>
<LI> US citizenship or resident alien (green card holder);
<LI>  you must be enrolled at least half-time (as determined
             by the particular college or university you are attending; and
<LI> you must be maintaining satisfactory progress (as determined by 
          the particular college or university you are attending).
</OL> <P>

     Although most programs specifically ban students on visitor or
student visas from receiving aid, there are some programs that have no
such limitations.  Some private loan funds will lend to non- resident
aliens if they have a relative in the States who can co- sign for
them.  Also, many private scholarships and assistantships are not
concerned with the citizenship of the recipient.  Therefore, if you
are planning on attending a school Stateside but are not a US citizen
or resident alien, the best thing you can do is to contact the school
which you plan to enter and ask them for help.  This will accomplish
two things. 1)They are in the best position to tell you what is
available at their institution, and 2)the way in which they respond to
your request will give you a good indication of the institutions's
commitment to graduate students in general, and your education in
particular.  Remember, your graduate education is a two-way street.
You are not alone in your education.  While it is not the
institution's responsibility to do your work for you, it is their
responsibility to assist you in certain ways.  If the institution in
which you are interested is not willing or able to help you in
something as primary as basic funding sources, there is a possibility
that they will be just as insensitive to graduate issues in other
areas.

<H3>Applying for Aid</H3>

     Once you have decided that you will apply for aid you will
encounter a dazzling array of application procedures.  The best
rule of thumb is to read all directions and follow them precisely. <P>
     The three applications that are most widely used in the US
are,
<OL>
<LI>  ACT Family Financial Statement
<LI>  CSS Family Financial Statement
<LI>  GAPSFAS application.
</OL>

These three applications collect the same core information, such as
family size, previous year's income, etc., but are very different
otherwise. <P>

<DL>
<DT>      American College Testing (ACT)
<DD>     The ACT form is the simplest of the three.  The applicant
fills in only base information.  There is no open space to explain
unusual circumstances.  This form is excellent for schools with
large undergraduate populations and little non-federal aid since it
requires minimal financial aid counselor involvement once the form
has been completed and returned.  Unfortunately, many graduate
students have unusual circumstances that are not easily
quantifiable using the ACT form by itself.  If the college that
uses this form does not have a supplemental form that allows you to
present a clearer picture of your situation, you may be at a
disadvantage.  Your situation may be unusual.  <P>
     Also, the use of the ACT form by an institution for both
undergraduate and graduate students may be an indication that the
university sees no difference between undergraduate and graduate
students.  This is a serious problem.  Graduate students have some 
different needs not felt by undergraduates, such as insurance and
research expenses.  Many graduate students are older, with higher
fixed expenses.  Universities that are not willing to recognize
these issues run the risk of being unaware of other graduate
concerns.

<DT> College Scholarship Service (CSS)
<DD>      The CSS form falls between the ACT and GAPSFAS forms in
information gathering capabilities.  It collects the core federal
information as well as supplemental information requested by
various states.  It also has an area for special circumstances.
Therefore, the applicant has a better chance of presenting his/her
situation.  While this form is not as involved as the GAPSFAS form,
it is better for graduate students than the ACT form.  In some
cases, schools find that this a good compromise form to use if they
have both graduate and undergraduate students.  It allows the
financial aid office some flexibility.


<DT>      GAPSFAS
<DD>     The GAPSFAS form is the most involved of the three major
forms.  It is also the only one used only by graduate and
professional schools.  It allows for the presentation of the most
information.  Use of the GAPSFAS form by a college is a good
indication that the administration is probably very concerned with
graduate and professional financial aid issues.

<DT> Other Forms
<DD>      You should be aware that each institution may have other
documents you will be required to submit before being considered
for or receiving aid.  These documents may include, but not be
limited to, prior year's tax returns, institutional applications,
and others.  Also, private agencies will all have their own
applications and requirements.  Neglecting to follow up with any
requested forms may cost you financial assistance.  You should
always check with your college to insure that all necessary
paperwork has been completed and returned. <P>
     If possible, get the name of a contact person at the
institution.  In some cases, this may not be possible or useful.
Larger institutions usually have so many people handling your case
that to try to work with just one person is not feasible.  Smaller
institutions, on the other hand, may be more interested in giving
you more personalized service. 
</DL>

<H3> Types of Aid</H3>

     Since there are numerous sources of information on the various
types of aid available, I will deal only briefly with this topic.
If you need more information I will direct you to your college's
financial aid office.  They should have the federal publications as
well as an institutional brochure. <P>
     There are four basic sources of financial aid, federal, state
or regional, institutional, and others.  The federal aid is either
filtered through the campus financial aid office or can come
directly to the student via programs such as Javitz fellowships.
State aid is generally channeled through the campus aid office but
may involve some outside initiation of action by the applicant.
Institutional aid comes from or through the university and can be
given by numerous departments on campus.  The last of the four,
other aid, can come from anywhere else. 

<DL>
<DT>Federal Aid 
<DD> Federal Aid has two sides.  It can come through the Financial
Aid Office or through outside federal agencies.  Most aid you will
encounter will probably be of the first type.  It includes the
following programs: 
<DL>
<DT> Stafford Loans (SSL)
<DD> Stafford Loans (SSL) are low cost, government guaranteed
          loan.  The government does not guarantee that you will be
          eligible for the loan, only that if something happens and
          you are unable to repay the loan, the government will
          reimburse the lending institution.  Eligibility for this
          loan is based on need, as discussed in the Needs Analysis
          section.  The maximum amount per year for a graduate
          student is $7500 or up to the unmet need of your
          institutionally defined student aid budget, whichever is
          less.  The interest varies from 8% per year while you are
          in school to 10% 5 years after graduation.  Interest does
          not accrue and you are not required to make payments
          until 6 months after you leave school.  Applications are
          available at your university or at any lending
          institution that is involved in the program.

<DT>  Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS)
<DD>      Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) is a higher cost
          loan which is also government guaranteed.  Eligibility
          for this loan is not based on need, and is therefore
          available to more students.  The maximum amount per
          academic year is $4000 or up to the unmet need of your
          institutionally defined student budget, whichever is
          less.  Applications for this loan are available in the
          university financial aid office or at any participating
          lending institution. <P>
               The interest on the SLS is trickier than that on the
          SSL.  The interest rate changes each July based on
          Treasury Bill rates but cannot exceed 12% per year.
          Interest accrues from the first day the check is cashed.
          You may decide to pay the interest as it occurs, usually
          monthly or quarterly or you may decide to defer interest
          payments.  If you defer interest payments, you should
          know that different banks have different ways of
          compounding the accrued interest.  Some banks compound
          and capitalize (add the outstanding interest to the
          principle of the loan so that the next interest will
          include both principle amount borrowed and the previous
          accrued interest) the interest immediately, some do this
          quarterly, and some do this yearly.  The best lenders,
          from a graduate student viewpoint, are those lenders who
          compound and capitalize your interest when you graduate.


<DT> Perkins Loans
<DD>          Perkins Loans, which were previously known as the
          National Direct Student Loan or NDSL, is the lowest cost,
          government sponsored loan.  This loan is based on need
          and is usually not available to all students.  The
          maximum amount varies from school to school but the funds
          received must not exceed the unmet need of your
          institutionally defined aid budget.  The interest rate is
          5% but the interest does not begin to accrue until 6
          months after you leave school.


<DT> College Work-Study
<DD>           College Work-Study is a work program whereby the student
          works on campus, generally for a fairly low wage.  Most
          universities target this program to undergraduates.

</DL>

<H4>Special Note: Needs Analysis</H4>
     All of these funds are approved on campus using a process
known as needs analysis.   Needs analysis involves using the
information you supplied on the previously discussed application to
ascertain how much assistance you need to attend school.  These
figures are then compared with the institutionally derived student
budget.  If the budget is higher than the amount the calculations
say that you are able to supply to fund your own education
(Expected Family Contribution) then you are eligible for the amount
over your funds. <P>
               Student Budget<BR>
               - Expected Family Contribution (EFC)<BR>
               -Other Resources<BR>
               =Aid Eligibility <P>
     While the base computations are fairly cut and dried,
individual offices do have some autonomy in changing the
computations.  The individual offices can apply what is known as
"Professional Judgement" to factor in non-core items.  For example,
if you had high medical bills in the previous year that ate up the
funds that the financial aid office says you should have available
to pay your tuition those bills can be included in your needs
analysis.  You will need to document the bills and meet with a
financial aid counselor to discuss your situation.  This is where
the difference in applications, and attitudes, can affect you. 
Some offices may have policies that discourage the presentation of
additional information. An office that is insensitive to these
types of problems may be indicative of insensitivity in other
areas, and on campus offices.  Be concerned if the Financial Aid
Office at the institution you are investigating is not interested
in helping you with individual problems.  The attitude is probably
coming down from higher administrators. <P>
     Please refer to the sections on Student Budgets and Budget
additions for more information.  Student Budgets are another area
where unusual expenses may be taken into consideration. <P>
     The other side of federal aid is that put into fellowships and
scholarships.  These programs are more difficult to locate,
involving more work on your part.  They also can be much more
rewarding, both financially and professionally.  The best places to
look for announcements for these programs are in departmental and
graduate studies offices. <P>


<DT>      State and Regional Funding
<DD> 
     State and regional funding is supplied by states or regions,
and comes in the form of both loans and grants.  The federal
financial aid information brochure available at most US financial
aid offices includes the list of all state aid agencies.  Regional
aid can be a little harder to find.  The aid is usually targeted to
particular target groups, such as potential health care providers.
Therefore, the best place to look for information can be graduate
studies offices and financial aid offices at the prospective
college or professional school.


<DT>      Institutional Funding
<DD> 
     Institutional funding includes graduate assistantships,
departmental fellowships, university scholarships, and any other
funding supplied by the educational institution or private donors
through the institution.  The main source of information on these
funds will be on the individual campuses.  Check with the
departments, the graduate studies offices, the financial aid
offices, and any other source you happen to hear about or encounter
while on your quest for funds. <P>
     Do not limit yourself to only dealing with your department,
especially when you first arrive on campus.  Oftentimes, a
department will hire a graduate student from another division
because of their need for special skills or because they simply
have an unfilled opening and no one to do the job.  This can be
particularly helpful to you if you are entering a department with
very limited graduate funding.  Make use of all possibilities.


<DT>      Other Funding
<DD> 
     Anything that is not included in the three previous sections
is included in this one.  Numerous other agencies, of all sorts,
offer some sort of assistance.  The list of sources for you to
investigate is only limited by your available time and current
contacts.  If you are willing to invest some time into a search you
may very well come up with extra aid. <P>
     The best place to start your search is to look around you. 
Many organizations have scholarship and/or loan programs for
employees and associates.  Large corporations often offer tuition
benefits for employees.  Some religious organizations have aid
programs for members.  Service organizations, like the Rotary
clubs, have assistance available to both members and non-members
alike.  Fraternal groups, ethnic organizations, and unions often
support their constituency through educational aid programs. 
Unfortunately, it may take you some time to locate these funds. 
The rewards, though, can sometimes be substantial.  Awards range
from  $100 to full funding to study overseas for one year. <P>
     The next place to look is your local main library.  The
reference section should contain books listing scholarship and loan
funds.  These books usually show their listings by constituency,
i.e. minority, female, etc.  Once again, this can take some time
but can also prove fruitful.  Do keep in mind, though, that many of
these funding sources are privately controlled.  Therefore, the
eligibility requirements and availability are subject to rapid
change. <P>
     The last place to look would be grant centers.  There are
three of these in the States of which I am aware.  One is located
in Los Angeles, one in San Francisco, and the third is in New York
City.  There may be more.  The one in Los Angeles is known as the
Grant Center and the other two are the Foundation Centers.  These
centers are supported by foundations wishing to disseminate
information on their programs.  They are mainly geared toward grant
funding for institutions but they do generally contain books on
individual funding.  They also teach short workshops on grant
finding which you may find useful if you plan to write a grant. <P>
     The one place I would generally urge you to avoid would be so-
called "scholarship finding" services.  They are fairly expensive
and usually not very effective in finding funding sources you
yourself could have uncovered with a minimum of effort.  The most
recent study of which I am aware regarding these services showed
that the majority of sources provided were already available to the
students through their financial aid offices.  But, if you wish to
try your luck, go ahead.  Caveat Emptor.
</DL>

<H3>The Financial Aid Office</H3>

     The Financial Aid Office will be one of your main contacts on
campus if you decide to apply for many kinds of financial aid.
Therefore, it would be useful for you to understand their
procedures and philosophies. <P>

<DL>
<DT>      People
<DD> 

     The people who work in financial aid offices are, for the most
part, very dedicated, well-meaning professionals.  A financial aid
office can be a high pressure place to work, with long hours a
regular part of the regime.  In larger offices, the people may
become somewhat detached from their student populations.  This is
rarely the case in smaller offices where counselors and directors
alike are very often face to face with students constantly. <P>
     Most counselors, and those above them, are required to have at
least a Master's Degree.  This is not always the case but it is
definitely the trend.  Financial aid evolved in the last twenty
years from a few easily managed programs to a plethora of
intricate, byzantine government regulations and requirements.  Many
schools started out with support staffs running their financial aid
programs, but this is quickly changing.  The amount of information
from  both the applicants and the government that an office must
process is staggering.  The financial aid profession is not for the
faint of heart. <P>
     Many financial aid professionals came into the field from the
liberal arts.  They are not business types and do not see
themselves as simply "paperpushers."  If you approach them with
that attitude you will be doing yourself and them a great
disservice.  Financial aid professionals are doing what they do
because they feel they can make a difference in the world.  They
are there to help. <P>
     Do not make the mistake of trying to exploit their concern. 
Most professionals have been practicing financial aid long enough
to know the tricks and the scams.  They are concerned, not stupid. 
Financial aid professionals want to help you use the system, not
misuse it. 


<DT>      Size
<DD> 
     Financial aid offices vary greatly in size, depending on many
factors.  As one would expect, larger student bodies require larger
offices.  Also, the amount and types of aid available will
influence the number of people needed to staff the office. <P>
     There are a few things that you should consider when looking
at the size of the office.  Are there enough staff people available
that you could get into see one within a reasonable period of time?
Financial aid does have very busy periods when counselors would not
be readily available, but generally you should be able to get into
a counselor within a week of making an appointment.  Too few
counselors mean long waits not only in lines but also in paperwork
processing.  Lastly, too few counselors could mean that the office
will be anxious to handle your file as little as possible.  This
means that your case could easily get a superficial, and unfair,
review simply because the staff is under the gun to review and
award as many student files as possible. <P>
     Does the staff appear to have enough working space?  This may
not seem like something that could affect you, but it might.  If
space is overly limited it could mean that the university
administration does not place a high value on financial aid
programs, and support.  If you are dependent on such programs you
should be aware that this lack of support could mean that financial
aid programs could be on the chopping block if budget cuts are
made.  Also, cramped working spaces can lead to unnecessary delays
in your paperwork.


<DT>      Student Budgets
<DD> 
     Student budgets are set by individual colleges, using the
federal requirements.  Generally speaking, graduate budgets in
similar or adjoining geographic areas should not vary greatly,
except for fees.  If you have received two budget quotes that vary
greatly you should look at the individual parts of the respective
budgets.  Most differences will occur because of differences in
fees and living expenses. <P>
     The base budget is made up of fees, books, room and board,
expected personal expenses such as toiletries, and local
transportation costs.  The costs are averaged out for every
student, and are not generally personalized.  If the institution
does not readily publish a breakdown of their expected student
budget you have the right to request a copy of it.  You need to
compare it with your personal budget.  If you have any questions
you can then make an appointment with a financial aid counselor to
explain their figures. <P>
      You should be aware that your budget may not match the
financial aid budget.  By federal guidelines, they do not include
budget items like credit card or car payments.  These things are
not allowable.  Your other living expenses may be more than those
shown on their budget.  Most student budgets assume that if you are
single you will be splitting housing expenses with at least one
other student.  While these budget items may not be flexible, other
expenses may be considered. <P>

<H4>Special Note: Budget Adjustments</H4>
     Although the initial paradigm for student budgets is fairly
clearcut, financial aid personnel do have some flexibility to
change your budget.  If they elect to use their "professional
judgement," they can add other items that they deem to be necessary
to your education.  The main types of budget adjustments include
the following areas:
<OL>
<LI> 
 Health.  If health insurance is not already included in your budget, it can 
be added. This expenses incurred while you are in school.  This does not include elective operations, such as
plastic surgery.
<LI> 
 Moving expenses.  These expenses can be funded if they are school related and
/or they occur while you are in school.
<LI> 
 Car expenses.  This is perhaps one of the mostcontroversial types of 
adjustments.  While schools cannot assist you with car payments they can
enlarge your budget to include particular repairs done while you are in school.
<LI> 
 Extra supply and book expenses.  If your book and supply expenses exceed 
those outlined in your aid budget, you can request that the additional amount 
be added to your  budget.
<LI> 
 Other expenses.  There are other expenses, such as bankruptcy payments, 
child support payments and other unusual expenses that financial aid offices can
include in your base budget.
</OL>

If you have any unusual expenses you should inform the financial
aid office know, especially before you decide to attend that
institution.  How the financial aid department reacts to your
situation will tell you a great deal about the financial aid office
and the college's view of graduate students.  There are many
expenses that an office is specifically prohibited from including
in your budget, but they do have some latitude. <P>
     If they are unwilling to work with you, there could be a
problem with their professional philosophy.  Some financial aid
offices view their job as fund caretakers, letting money loose only
when forced to do so.  These offices tend to lump undergraduates
and graduates into the same group.  Not only will they cause you to
be unnecessarily financially strained during your time at that
school, they may also represent an administration that is less that
sympathetic to graduate students.   This attitude should make you
reconsider whether or not you want to be involved with the
institution.

<DT> Appeals
<DD> 
     
     You have the right to appeal any decision to the Financial Aid
Director.  You should be aware that the counselors rarely act on
their own.  They are usually acting within the rules set by the
federal government and the institution.  But if you feel that you
have not had a full hearing you do have the right to appeal. 
Appeal procedures vary from school to school but they are required
to be published.  Therefore, you should be able to get the
procedures from the financial aid office.
</DL>

<H3>What to Look for in a Financial Aid Office</H3>

     As a graduate student, your concerns will be different than
those of your undergraduate colleagues.  You are probably older and
more experienced.  Your expenses will be higher and more varied. 
If the financial aid office does not recognize these differences
you may wish to consider that when you are deciding which school to
attend.  There are several ways to tell if a financial aid office,
and a university, are sensitive to these differences. <P>
     Are undergraduate aid and graduate aid overseen by the same
people?  The best situation is the one in which the graduate and
undergraduate aid programs are administered out of separate offices
and by different counselors.  Barring that situation, there should
at least be different counselors for the graduate students.
Graduate students invariably get short shrift when they are
considered for aid with undergraduates. <P>
     What type of aid application does the office use?  Is it
simple, or does it give you more room for an explanation of your
situation.  In this case, simple is definitely not better.  A
simple form may be an indication that the staff is overworked and
underfunded.  If that is true, you may very well suffer needless
delays and an office that is not interested in your situation. <P>
     What type of aid does the university offer?  If their aid is
limited to federal monies and loan funds you might be walking into
a school that is either financially strapped or disinterested in
graduate students.  Either case could cause you problems down the
road. <P>
     How do current students feel about the financial aid office? 
Invariably, someone will have an axe to grind, but that should not
be the general student opinion.  If the current students are not
satisfied with the financial aid office, chances are your
experiences will not differ greatly from theirs. <P>
     All of the above questions are ultimately part of one main
question.  What is the prospective college's or university's
attitude towards and interest in graduate students?  If the
attitude is negative, it will affect your entire time at that
institution. <P>

<H3>       Your Rights and Responsibilities as a Student</H3>

     You have certain rights and accompanying responsibilities when
you become involved with financial aid, especially if it comes
through the campus financial aid office. <P>

          includes all additional documentation that an institution
          or other funding agency may require.

<LI> 
          It is your responsibility to read and understand all
          forms that you sign.  You should always keep a copy of
          any forms that you sign.

<LI> 
          It is your responsibility to maintain academic
          satisfactory progress as stated by the institution.

<LI> 
          You must notify the institution  of any change in your
          situation, such as change of name or address, new
          funding, or enrollment.
</OL>
	
     In the end, it is your responsibility to learn as much as
possible about an academic institution before enrolling.  Your time
there may very well be spent in your department, but many other
areas of the institution will affect you.  Financial aid can make
or break an academic experience.  Be aware of what you will be
getting at your chosen institution.  Although your decision may not
be altered by what you learn, you will know what to expect during
your (very costly) time in graduate 
school. <P>

For foreign students, SSAS0@ib.rl.ac.uk (Sara Sengenberger) adds some good info
: <P>

Try looking in The Grants Register 1993 - 1995, ed Lisa Williams,
pub Macmillan 1992. This is an excellent all-around source of information for
anyone seeking funding at or above the graduate level. It isn't terribly well
organised, but it is comprehensive, and I presume you're sufficiently motivated
to plough through many pages in search of money! <P>


Another good book that I can recommend is  "THE PRENTICE HALL GUIDE TO
SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS FOR MATH AND SCIENCE STUDENTS", by Mark Kantrowitz
and Joann P. DiGennaro. It is "A Resource for Students Pursuing Careers in 
Mathematics, Science, and Engineering". It also talks about the following : 

<UL>
<LI> 
     How to uncover all possible sources of financial aid, assess career
      goals, obtain the most useful letters of recommendation from teachers,
      and get nominated for scholarships and fellowships. 

<LI> 
     How to choose an undergraduate school that best meets your needs --
      evaluating everything from courses of study and instructors to social
      atmosphere and extracurricular activities. 

<LI> 
     How to improve your chances of being accepted by the graduate school
      of your choice. Here are key pointers on what to put into a Statement
      of Purpose, how to achieve the highest score on the Graduate Record
      Examination, how to choose an advisor, and how to select a thesis
      topic and write a thesis proposal.
