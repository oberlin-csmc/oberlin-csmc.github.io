The original unfinished edition was written by Jui-Yuan Fred Hsu, whom
I have tried to contact, with no response (Fred, if you're around send
me an E-mail !). I therefore decided to reorganise it, update all the
rankings, etc and then add a lot of new topics that have appeared on
the newsgroup. <P>
