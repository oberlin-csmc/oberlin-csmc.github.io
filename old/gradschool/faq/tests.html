<H1>Standard Tests</H1>

The GRE and the GMAT are required by most Universities around the
world. The TOEFL is required for foreign students whose mother tongue
is not English. It is however usually (with a few exceptions) not
required if you are a non-English speaker but graduated from a
University in an English-speaking University; you would however have
to apply for a TOEFL waiver. The MCAT and LSAT are for the medical and
Law entrance exams, but according to my knowledge, only US and
Canadian Univs require them (there might be exceptions). <P>

Q : How long are GRE scores valid for ? <P>

A: <BR>

According to the information with the test registration packet, for tests
taken beginning in 1985, ETS retains the scores for five years "from the
date of your test."  This suggests to me that you could have scores sent 
for an October 1989 test, but only for a little while longer.  After that 
they will not report your scores.  You would need to contact ETS to find 
out the actual cutoff.  <P>

Prior to 1985, there were different policies at various times.  When ETS
reports old scores they go to great lengths to point out that the scores
are old.  They do not report the scores on either tape or disk, and the
paper score report contains a notation that the scores are more than five
years old.  In addition, ETS includes a standard memorandum which 
basically says "Since it has been five years since the test was taken, 
you really can't use these scores to assess the testee's *current* 
capabilities.." <P>

Jim (huang@mwilliams.eche.ualberta.ca) also adds the official caption : <P>

"The following captions appear on the GRE additional score order form.  <P>

EFFECTIVE SINCE OCTOBER 1985, GRE SCORES ARE REPORTABLE FOR FIVE YEARS
(i.e., until September 15 following the 5th anniversary 0f your test
date).  IF YOU TESTED PRIOR TO OCTOBER 1985, SCORES ARE REPORTED
ACCORDING TO THE POLICY TAHT WAS IN EFFECT WHEN THE TEST WAS
TAKEN." <P>

<HR>
<B>Q: What are the various GRE Subject Tests like ?</B> <P>

A:  <BR>

I honestly do not know and I have not read anything specific about it but I
can tell you about the Computer Science and Engineering ones. The Computer
Science tests your basic concepts and if you have a sound knowledge of the
courses you studied in your last 2 years of Univ, then you will probably do
will on it. As for the Engineering Subject test, and in general for the case of 
the GRE Test, if you're not asked for it, don't do it, unless you're 
previous GPA/MPAs were not good enough - but then you have to be 
confident of getting a good score, otherwise you might end-up with a 
double disaster instead of one !! The Engineering Test consists of 
several sections with each section pertaining to a different discipline 
of engineering. <P>

The ones that I had my degree in were not that hard (they however
tested basic concepts) so if you know your stuff second-nature, it
should not pose as a problem. However for the rest of the sections,
God help you !It basically requires you to have remembered everything
that you studied in your first 2 to 3 years of compulsory subjects
relating to engineering (+a little more extra), including
thermodynamics, electrical engineering, vibrations, dynamics, etc. and
with a good knowledge and not of "I recognise this equation, but how
do you use it ?!" <P>

You will also notice that becuase of this wide variation, most good 
Engineering schools (eg MIT, CalTech, etc) do not require it, but there 
are others who might require it. However my advice would be "Do not do the
Engineering Test" unless asked to do so and you can remember everything that you
studied in your first 2 to 3 years ! <P>

Robbie Westmoreland (robbiew@inviso.com) also adds some information about the 
History test : <P>

 I took the History subject test, and there are many differences between
it and the CS and Eng. tests you discussed.  It's 195 questions in two
hours and 50 minutes.  About two thirds of the questions are based on
U.S. history, 30% on European history (all periods) and the remainding
(small) part on "world" history.  The questions are slanted toward
recent history (>1800).  Basically, it's a really long trivia test
covering political, economic, artistic and social history, but with
a concentration on the political.  Recommended prep is going through
the old test published by ETS and brushing up on U.S. history.  Score
range is theoretically 200-970, but the 99th percentile starts around
720. <P>

Sheldon Rowan (u9112801@muss.cis.mcmaster.ca) describes the Biochemistry test : <P>

  Essentially the biochemistry, cell & molecular biology GRE test is 
exactly what it says it will be.  Having recently taking the subject test 
during the latest administration in October, I think there are some 
strategies that will be useful, and others that will be a waste of time. <P>

   Firstly the sample problems they send along with the registration 
confirmation is not horribly useful.  There are only 44 questions while 
the acutal test was 180 questions.  The best advice the GRE people give 
you is to review all of your undergraduate courses.  I had to draw upon 
the resources of at least 8 undergraduate biology and biochemistry 
courses I have taken to be able to answer all questions asked. <P>

   Don't dwell on the specifics in biochemistry too much.  Most of the 
biochemistry you need to know will be covered in very good cell biology 
books like Alberts or Darnell.  It might be worth your while to remember 
names of things.  Much to my chagrin, there were few questions that 
involved scientific reasoning and extrapolation.  It was basically: the 
structure of this is ......  The drug _____ does the following.  Maybe 
know the names of a few key enzymes in biochemical processes eg 
phosphofructokinase, but don't go nuts.  If your undergraduate education 
is lacking is some areas of the test, you might want to refer to certain 
sections in the biology GRE test.  I think much of the cell biology and 
elementary molecular biology on the biology subject is quite relevant for 
the test.   <P>

   Overall, the test was as hard as they say.  I still can't get over the 
detail they expected us to know things.  GRE prohibits me from revealing 
any acutal test questions, but suffice to say I didn't every need to 
think about anything.  It was either you knew it or you didn't.  Know 
that second year cell biology really really well, and bon chance. <P>

In addition, Howard C. Huang (huang@husc.harvard.edu) gives a few typical
scores of the Computer Science Test : <P>

The January, 1991 issue of Communications of the
ACM has an article by Gary Eerkes called "Profiling Computer
Science Master's Programs." One of the questions in their survey of
schools was apparently "What is the minimum GRE and GPA you expect
from  applicants?" The AVERAGES of all the responses were: <P>

<UL>
<LI> Verbal:       473 (51%ile)     
<LI> Quantitative: 650 (73%ile)     
<LI> Analytic:     592 (71%ile)     
<LI> V + Q:       1070
<LI> V + Q + A:   1603
<LI> CS Subject:  652 (66%ile)
<LI> Overall GPA: 3.0
<LI> GPA in CS:   3.1
</UL>

The HIGHEST responses given for each category were: <P>

<UL>
<LI> Verbal:       655 (90%ile)     
<LI> Quantitative: 750 (92%ile)     
<LI> Analytic:     750 (96%ile)     
<LI> V + Q:       1400
<LI> V + Q + A:   2000
<LI> CS Subject:  807 (97%ile)
<LI> Overall GPA: 3.7
<LI> GPA in CS:   3.8
</UL>

A few notes: <P>

<OL>
<LI>The numbers given are supposed to be MINIMUMS. 
<LI> This was intended to be a survey of Master's, not Ph.D., programs. 
<LI> Please check the actual article for more details and to make sure I
   didn't make any errors. <P>
</OL>

Most schools do not tell you what their averages are.  Berekeley (CS)
<EM>does</EM> expect GREs > 90% on both the general and subject according to
their lit.   <P>

Many schools do report either the minimums expected or the average
scores of people admitted. For example, I believe Illinois, Washington
and Texas all give some information in their CS application brochures. <P>

<HR>
<B>Q: What would be a good score ?</B> <P>

A:  <BR>
For Engineering, in general,  <P>

From: ramaa@wasp.eng.ufl.edu (arun ramamurthi) <P>

If you are applying to engineering grad schools, a quantitative score of 
>= 700 is desirable.  In general, a combined score of > 1300 (Verbal + 
Quantitative) is generally required for consideration for admission to the top 
10-15 schools However, the impression I have gotten from talking to grad 
coordinators at various departments is this : if your GRE scores are extremely 
high, they are not of much help...if your GRE scores are abnormally low, they 
hurt you.  <P>

Forget the GRE...make sure you get good, strong letters of
recommendations - this is probably the most important thing (with GPA for
the last 60 credit hours the second most important criteria).  
And make sure you have a good reason for going to grad
school...nothing ticks off a grad coordinator more than having
to review an application from someone who has no idea why he/she
wants to pursue graduate studies. <P>

Another Set of Questions : <P>

From: clin@eng.umd.edu (Charles Lin) <P>

msv9203@tamsun.tamu.edu (Marshall Scott Veach) writes:<BR>
<B>Does anyone know a way to find out the average acceptance scores
of various graduate schools in computer science? I mean knowing
what the average GPA/GRE scores of the last couple of classes
would make an *overwhelming* difference in being able to figure  out
which schools I can get into and which I cant - which I can count on
as safety schools etc...</B> <P>

    Well, you could try to call the university and find out.
They might not tell you, but then, they might. <P>

<B>
Even if this information isn't available in a quantitative form does
anyone know in general what the requirements are like for the  
top 5 vs. the second 5 vs. the 10 - 20 schools?</B> <P>

    It's preferable to be somewhere in the 90th percentile 
on the Subject test, which is roughly 45 correct questions
out of 80, last I saw.   Sample GREs should have a chart
that converts your scaled score (number correct - 1/4
number incorrect) into a percentile. <P>

<HR>
<B>Q: I have already done the GRE and am thinking of retaking it - should I ?</B> <P>

A: <BR>
The Educational Testing Service's statistics show that most people who 
retake the GREs do better.  Whether this is because testees are better 
prepared because of familiarity with the test format, or simply because 
people retake the test because they expect to do better, ETS does not 
speculate. <P>

<OL>
<LI> Overall scores may be important, but faculty in different 
disciplines are likely to look at scores differently:  High scores on the 
verbal measure are more likely to be important for admission to an 
English department than to a Chemistry department.  High scores on the 
Quantitative measure are more likely to be important for admission to a 
Physics department than to a Philosophy department.  <P>

In recognition of this, ETS is proposing (long term) a modular format for
the GRE in which each institution which uses GRE scores would specify
which modules need to be taken for applying to specific disciplines. 

<LI> Unless one is applying to the most competitive programs in the 
country (so that the applicant pool is composed primarily of persons with 
80 or 90th percentile rankings), if one's rank is no lower than the 56th 
percentile in any of the measures, I'd say those scores were better than 
respectable.

<LI> In most cases, GREs are one of several factors relating to graduate 
admission.  I would be surprised if GRE scores alone in the top 50th 
percentile kept anyone out of a graduate program.

<B>Q: I have sent an application form in which I choose the General test only. Now
I would like to apply for a subject test too, what can I do? send another form? </B><P>

A: You will have to fill out another registration from and pay the fee to 
take a subject exam.   <P>

Once you have taken both the subject and general tests and the scores for
both are officially reported, both general and subject test scores will
appear on the official score reports that ETS sends to the schools you 
choose for the next five years or so.  You will not need to request the 
scores separately. <P>

<H3>Computerised GRE</H3>

<B>Q: Is the GRE Computerised version any different ? </B><P>

A: From: muffiew@edc.org (Muffie Wiebe) <P>

The real issue is that the test is now <EM>very</EM> different in the elctronic
form, at least according to the ETS explanatory sheet I read about 6 months
ago. <P>

I took the GRE computer test in Jan 1993.  I loved it.  It was exactly the
same structure as the written test, only on a computer with a mouse-driven
interface. <P>

Several of the features made it faster and easier.  (eg:  there was a
hypercard like way to bounce between a list of all the questions, with
their current status marked (answered, not answered, marked to return to,
or not yet read.)  From this list you could easily see where you needed to
go back and could move to that question in a click.)  Some made it harder. 
I found the logic problems hard to hold in my head, and ended up writing
down the answers so that I could cross them off as I eliminated them. <P>

But - it has been radically restructured since then. <P>

The new computer test is touted as somewhat dynamic now.  It judges how
well you do on one question and uses that information to select the next
queston.  This has (at least) two ramifications, neither of which is good
given the test taking strategies in various guides: <P>

<OL>
<LI> You have to answer the questions sequentially
<LI> You can't go back to a question once you've answered it.

<LI> 
        1 verbal arguments section (16 questions)
</UL>
<LI> 
    1 25-30-minute multiple-choice section of reading comprehension
        (18-25 questions)
<LI> 
    1 25-30-minute experimental repeating one of the above multiple-
        choice sections
</UL>
The total administration of the GMAT is now 3.9-4.1 hours, not including
the break.  Scoring is 200-800 for the multiple-choice sections (with the
percentiles for verbal and quantitative separated, but only one three-digit
score).  Scoring for the essays is from 0-6 in half-point increments.Copies
of the essays will be sent to schools that receive scores.
