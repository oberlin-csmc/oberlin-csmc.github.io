Hi.  I'm Joan Francioni and along with Ginnie Lo and Barbara
Ryder I'm going to talk about the teaching component of academics.
You've heard a lot this morning about things that you have to do,
research-wise and service-wise in an academic position, but that fact 
that you're in an academic position distinguishes you from a purely 
research position in that there is this teaching component.   <P>

Let me start off by talking about what the benefits of teaching are.  
Independent of whatever benefits there are for you, the teacher, the 
primary reason that you are teaching is to educate the students.  It's
important to keep in mind that there is this serious purpose for your 
teaching.  For you yourself, there are a number of benefits, but I'm 
going to talk about three right here.  One is just the pleasure and 
satisfaction you get out of teaching.  It can be quite a rewarding 
experience to take people who don't understand a concept and teach them 
and move a whole class forward.  In addition to that, you will undoubtedly 
have a much deeper understanding of anything you have to teach.  The deeper 
understanding of the material comes via the course prep that you have to do 
and also from interacting with students, as they will constantly be asking 
you questions and challenging things that you've said.  The third benefit 
to teaching, which is relevant to what was talked about earlier today about 
being connected in the research community, is that you develop your own 
communication skills.  You get a lot of practice talking to people and 
explaining things in a clear and organized way.  (You also get a very good 
feel for what fifty minutes is, which is I think why some of us are running 
over our time slots today.) --Laughter <P>

As with most things in life, everything comes at a cost.  Your real cost 
for teaching is the enormous amount of time and energy it takes.  And you 
can put as much time and energy as you possibly have into teaching and you 
will still feel as if you could put more.  You've heard earlier that you 
will have this same conflict and pull on your time from the research side, 
so I remind you that you must find a balance that works for you.  You can 
minimize the cost and maximize the benefits of teaching by teaching courses 
of interest to you -- ones that will motivate you to put in the time and 
energy that you need and that will reward you with a deeper understanding
of the subject.  But I think it's really important to take note of the
following: that teaching is usually not rewarded externally, commensurate 
with the effort that it requires.  Therefore, if you can not find some 
internal satisfaction from teaching then you really shouldn't be in this
type of job, okay?   <P>

For the rest of my talk I'm going to discuss how students learn so that
you can understand where they're coming from, and I'll talk about a few
specific teaching techniques that you can use to help.  Following that,
Ginnie's going to talk about grading and test assignments and Barbara's 
going to talk about some of the special problems that come up.   <P>

In general, there have been a number of psychological and educational 
studies done on how people learn.  In particular, it is believed that 
students view the world based on certain general structures, i.e., there is 
a framework that the student tries to fit everything into.  In addition, 
these structures change over time in a fairly well understood pattern.  
Where your students are and what structure they're dealing with at that 
point in their lives will affect how they interpret and how they perceive 
things that you tell them.  Also, students won't always move willingly
from one structure to the next.  Thus it's important to know where they are
and to always be pushing them to move forward. <P>

[The following structures are adapted from the book: Forms of Intellectual 
and Ethical Development in the College Years by William G. Perry; Holt, 
Rinehart and Winston, Inc; 1968.]
The first structure is when people see the world in a binary type of
mode.  Things are either right and therefore good or they are wrong and
therefore bad.  Students in this structure feel that as the teacher,
you're the one who knows the right answers so your job is to teach
those answers to the students and then it's the students' job to remember 
them.   As an example, you may be giving a lecture where you're going off 
on an interesting tangent to motivate the class and you see a hand go up.
You think -- "Great, they're interested in this." -- but the question
is "Is this going to be on the test?"  Now, Barbara says that she always 
answers "Yes." -- Laughter.  Nonetheless, the question can be demoralizing 
because it seems the students are not really interested in what you're 
talking about.  But if you can remember that the reason you're getting 
that question is because the student is working within this first
structure, then it helps you to deal with the question and the student
more effectively.  This, by the way, is typical for your first-year 
students. <P>

In their second year of college, students usually move into the next
structure: perceiving diversity of opinion.  As an example, a student in 
your class hears you say one thing on a certain topic when a teacher in 
a previous class said something different.  The students start to catch 
on that different people tell them different things but they don't have 
the depth of understanding yet to realize that things are different in 
different contexts.  Thus they usually attribute hearing the different 
opinions to either (1) the teacher is unqualified and doesn't know what's 
going on, whereby they become antagonistic with you, or (2) they think
"Oh, I get it. They're just testing us.  This is an exercise and we have 
to find out the right answer."  Notice that they will assume there is "the"
right answer.  There aren't two.  It is just their job to figure out what
"it" is.  When you know that this is how students are -- where they are,
where they're coming from -- it can help you understand their reaction 
to your methods.   <P>

The third structure is where students start accepting that all this
diversity of opinion and general uncertainty is legitimate; it actually 
exists and will continue to exist.  As an example of the students' behavior
from within this structure, consider the test question: "Which is the best 
sorting algorithm to use in the following situation?"  In class, you had 
covered a few sorts and talked about how they work.  You want the students 
to look at the pros and cons of the different sorting algorithms in relation 
to how each would fit with the example scenario you've posed and to make 
a decision.  But, that's not what they're likely to do while in this
structure.  They do know they're supposed to justify their answer because
they're going to be graded on "good expression," but they don't
really understand what the grading standards are.  So they try to write 
everything they can think of about sorts.  (And if you only leave them
a small amount of space for their answer, they'll just write smaller. 
--Laughter)  A better strategy is to try and structure your questions, as
well as your general dealings with the students, to try and force them to 
address the differences.   <P>

Eventually students will move into this fourth structure where they start 
perceiving all knowledge and values (including the authority's) as 
contextual and relativistic.  For many people, this is when college life 
really becomes exciting -- when you start understanding that everybody has 
these different opinions that are based on where they're coming from.
In particular, this is when your students finally start understanding, not 
just that they're supposed to say "It depends," but why that is often the 
correct answer.  <P>

Given that background on where students are coming from, I'll now talk a 
little bit about learning strategies that people use.  A natural tendency
in teaching is to try and emulate teachers that you thought were really 
good. One reason you felt they were so good is because the style that 
they used in teaching worked well for you to learn things.  What you have 
to recognize as a teacher is that students will have a variety of learning 
strategies and they will not all learn best in the same way as you do.  
I remember as a student I never liked to read the book that much.  I 
preferred to get the information out of the lecture.  Therefore when I 
first started teaching I never gave reading assignments.  I felt students
should come to class and follow the lectures since that was the best way
for them to learn.  If a student asked about what part the book we were
on, I would tell them to look in the index for some of the key words I
was using and read those sections if they wanted to! ---Laughter--  
Later on I found out that certain people have a more visual orientation 
and learn better if they can read about a topic before or after hearing 
about it in a lecture, whereas others learn better by hearing it presented.
As other examples, some people like a more competitive class situation 
than others; some students do well in groups projects and some don't; etc.
The key thing here is to recognize that students in your classes will have 
different learning strategies and therefore, it is most effective if you
can provide a variety of learning situations for them.  Try and remember
different methods and styles used in classes you took as a student; things 
that didn't work great for you but might work great for somebody else.   <P>

Lets look now at some general teaching strategies and then I will go into 
more specifics on course content.  Again, this is based on basic theory of 
pedagogy.   Most people know, I think, that you learn by doing and therefore 
it's much better if your students are active listeners and viewers then if 
everybody just sits there and takes notes.  But even though we know this
is true in theory, that doesn't mean you can always implement these ideas
in the kind of class situation that you end up being in.  Nonetheless,
you can do things to encourage students to be active participants on
some level.  For example, in situations where you don't have enough time
to have a total interactive class you can still ask rhetorical questions 
and let the students think of an answer before you go ahead and give 
it. <P>

Another teaching strategy is to include repetition of concepts but via 
different experiences.  If students don't understand something, just saying 
it to them the same way over and over won't help.  You have to come at it 
from different ways.   <P>

Concepts should also be reinforced, and positive reinforcement is better 
than negative reinforcement.  There is a tendency in certain situations
to give negative reinforcement -- in particular in grading.  For example,
a 10-point test question would usually be graded as -3 rather than +7.
This is because most people find it easier to think in these terms.  But
you can compensate for this by putting a few check marks or "good" remarks
here and there when appropriate. <P>

It can be very effective in teaching to provide opportunities for students 
to generalize and discriminate among concepts -- to take things that are 
in different situations and find what's in common and what's different 
among them.  In addition, you want to motivate your students to be
active learners.  Mary Vernon made a statement this morning that in your 
own research you should work on problems that you think are important.  She 
said that so that you will motivate yourself, and that exact same comment 
goes for your students.  If you can convince them that they are looking 
for answers to questions that they think are important, then they will.
No matter how good a lecturer you are, of course, if the student does not 
want to learn, the student won't learn.  Thus, you must also try to provide
different conditions in which they can become motivated.   <P>

Sometimes a student is motivated but is also dealing with conflicts and 
frustrations in understanding the material.  Try to recognize this and
provide avenues for them to get around it. <P>

Finally, a very important teaching strategy is to provide an atmosphere of
cooperation between you and the students.  If you have the attitude that
you're doing your job of preparing the lectures and it's up the students
to learn the material if they want to or not, then it makes for a tense 
class.  Rather it is more conducive for the students to learn when they 
have the feeling like you're interested in them learning the material.  More 
like the tests are there for you to know whether the class is catching on or
not, instead of as a way to punish the students who haven't caught on yet.
You can't always be "on their side" so to speak, but you sometimes can and
you should make an effort to do so when it is feasible. <P>

All right, so let's look at a few specifics on general course content.  For 
one, make the course objectives known to your students up front.  It is 
also useful to reiterate them a few times during the semester.  You are 
trying to motivate the students and you are trying to let them know that 
there are important reasons for studying this material besides just "I
need to take this course because it is a required course and I need to pass 
it to get my degree so I can finally get out and start making some money."
--Laughter--  That shouldn't be their only motivation.  For example, in 
operating systems your course objectives might include: to understand
concurrency in parallel programming.  You could then discuss why parallel
programming is important in scientific applications, let's say.  This helps
provide different motivations for students instead of just expecting the
students to want to learn because "operating systems stuff is really cool 
and you should like it just for it's own sake." <P>

Another specific suggestion is to use multiple sources for your lecture notes.
But here you have a couple of conflicting objectives.  You want to provide 
the student with different ways of looking at things but you must also
remember that they don't know the subject ahead of time.  So if your text
book uses certain definitions and notations, and then you use different
definitions or notations in class from another book that you preped from,
that's going to totally confuse them.  They don't really understand it 
enough to see how the two different notations really mean the same thing 
and to extrapolate the essence out of that.  The goal is to give them 
different examples than the text book has and present the material in 
different ways but still be consistent with the text book.  <P>

It can be very helpful to the students if you can connect topics in one
class to other C.S. classes.  In particular, this helps students to
generalize certain concepts.  So, for example, if you are teaching 
concurrency in operation systems, you can also discuss how that same 
issue comes up in database systems.  It is also useful to incorporate 
references and experiences outside of the department.  Making analogies
to real world concepts is one way, like talking about lines at the bank or 
the grocery store when you're lecturing about queueing theory.  Another is 
to discuss applications of computer science topics. I have found that many
undergraduates, in particular, get started in the program and just keep
going from course to course without really knowing much about what you can 
do as a computer scientist.  Sometimes they don't catch on until they are 
seniors and start thinking about what jobs they can get.  It helps if, in 
your classes, you take a little time now and then to tell them about 
different applications of what you're covering.  This also helps them feel
the excitement of the field and can help reinforce certain issues.  
Another strategy here is to arrange for guest lectures in other departments 
if possible.  This tends to give students a very different perspective on the
topic and again can tie in some things that they might be learning in another 
class in another department.  Some examples would be to invite a psychologist
into an A.I. class, a linguist into a Programming Languages class, or an
economist into a Software Engineering class.  On the first example, one of the
applicants to this workshop mentioned a situation where a psychologist was 
invited into an A.I. class.  The psychologist was doing work on neurobiology
and so brought in this bucket and pulled out a human brain. --Laughter--  <P>

A concrete thing that you can do to really help your students is to make
effective use of the board.  Again I would stress that you should remember 
that the students don't understand the topic when you are first trying to 
teach it to them.  So when you are going along explaining and you just kind 
of scribble little things on the board -- that's fine if they already know 
it and the board notes are just to jog their memory.  But when these students 
go back and look at their notes to try and understand something that they 
don't know to begin with, such notes don't help them at all.  A few simple 
hints are to try and write legibly; to always put key concepts on the board;
to make an effort to be somewhat structured as you are moving across the 
board and avoid always working on one section and constantly erasing just
that part of the board; and use correct spelling -- if you can't think of how 
to spell a word, pick another one. --Laughter--   <P>

And lastly, try to be an as organized as possible.  A little unorganization
can really hurt.  Say you are rushed and you you don't have time to make a 
up a thorough assignment, so you just kind of throw something together.
This will usually come back to haunt you, especially if you have large numbers
of students because they will all be at your door or sending you email
trying to clarify what is going on.  And you will end up spending much more 
time "fixing" the assignment than it would have taken to set it up right
in the beginning. <P>

On another topic, let's talk about how you can meet the needs of so many
different kinds of students.  Students come in all shapes and sizes -- from
the at-risk to the exceptional, male and female, multicultural.  And, in 
particular, as you finish graduate school your peers are a very select 
group of computer scientists.  So then you go in and start teaching 
undergraduate students and you think to yourself "Why are they so stupid?"
--Laughter---  They aren't really stupid.  They just aren't Ph.D.' students
and they don't know all this already and they are working in these different 
structures so that they can't understand everything you are saying for what 
it really is.  You have to work on trying to meet all of these different 
needs because your job as an educator is not just to pull the exceptional 
students through the program.  It's not always easy to do, mind you, but
you should at least recognize that and be prepared to work on it.  I can
offer a few specific suggestions that might help you along the way. <P>

The first one is to distinguish what you can do from what is fair to do to 
help out students.  Usually enough time and effort will help out most
students, but is that really fair to you, the student, and the rest of the 
class?  You need to consider this question so that you know how far you
should go to help someone out. <P>

It usually helps you to know how well you're getting across to the students
when you can get feedback from the class as a whole.  In some classes
you'll have the brightest students answering as well as asking all the
questions; in others it will be the slower students giving most of the
feedback.  But you need feedback from the whole group so as to be able to 
judge where they are and to adjust how quickly you are moving or not. <P>

Find out what's going on in your own university about tutoring options
available to students.  Sometimes there are classes for English and writing 
and if you have students who write poorly then you can send them off to
a class like that.  Keeping regular office hours  -- and being in during
your office hours -- helps out a lot.  This helps the students to know
when they can get help, and it also allows you to not be on call 24 hours
a day. <P>

Try to be approachable to your students.   Research on sex bias in teaching 
evaluations indicates that just smiling now and then makes students feel
much more comfortable with a teacher.  Giving a warm smile now and then 
makes students feel like you are cooperating with them.  On the other hand,
although you might think a sarcastic comment is funny, it is almost always 
taken the wrong way, at least by somebody in the class.  And you are going 
to end up hurting somebody's feelings.   <P>

And last, but not least, always try to maintain your professionalism and 
grading standards. <P>

We're going to switch gears now and Ginnie is going to talk about making
up tests and assignments and the general grading aspects of teaching. <P>


<DT> <B>Ginnie Lo</B>
<DD> 

Hi, I'm Ginnie Lo from the University of Oregon and I got my PhD from
the University of Illinois.  My area of research is parallel and
distributed computing and I just got tenure at the University of
Oregon of which I am very happy about. --Applause.  I did it in a slightly 
nontraditional path because of strong commitments to family, both my kids
and my parents who were elderly, and if someone would like to hear more
about taking "another" route, I can talk to them later on.  I will say
it took longer than usual but it worked out very well for me.   <P>

Right now I'm going to talk about assignments and tests and give some 
suggestions for writing good homework assignments and good tests.  This 
is actually something that can be quite enjoyable and that takes a lot
of creativity.  It's something I enjoy very much as part of my teaching 
responsibilities.  I also want to give you some hints about how to do 
this efficiently without too much of a time commitment because for most 
of you you will be teaching in the context of a university whose criteria 
for tenure is mostly research productivity.  And then I want to give you 
some general suggestions for managing time with respect to teaching, not 
just for working on homeworks and tests. <P>

My first slide is a little bit more oriented towards writing a good 
homework assignment problem or a good exam question.  Two 
suggestions I have are that (1) you want to promote cooperative problem
solving among your students as well as individual problem solving.  So
my homework assignments always have a mixture of group problems and 
individual problems.  This is not just programming assignments -- it's
even written assignments.  For the group assignments I help form the
groups or I let them form their own and then help adjust them a little
bit.  They work on the problem together with open discussion and they 
turn in one solution and each individual member of the group gets the 
same grade.  For the group grade on that problem I don't try to
distinguish who gets what; I just take the group product and grade
it.  I've gotten lots of feedback from students who have said they
really enjoyed those group problems.  They tend to be more open ended
types of problems with some creativity or with some debatable points 
in the problems so that they have a chance to interact and discuss their
viewpoints.   That's one guideline and then the other one is that when 
you write questions, especially on an exam, write a variety of types of 
questions.  You want to write some questions that are computational and 
some that are essay because I think communication skills are extremely 
important and they have sort of been undervalued in our field.  You may want 
to write a variety of questions as far as how they test the information.
Basic questions are just kind of drill type questions where the answer 
comes back in a very objective form -- sort of a straight forward "spit 
back what you have learned" type of question.  I try to write a lot of 
questions that integrate so that it's not a form of a question they will 
have seen in homework.  Rather I try to take two things they have learned 
and put them together to see if they can assimilate what they have learned 
and apply it to something else. And I write open ended questions and those 
are usually on a take home exam so that they can show me how they can 
take the material beyond just the minimum requirements of the class.   <P>

I like to think of grading such that if someone gets a C in my class it's not 
because they sort of have a half foggy notion of what the material was, but 
that they have attained a basic level of competence.  Of course, that's 
what our definition of A, B,  and C is, but when it comes out in the numbers 
sometimes getting a 70 in the class means someone just two-thirds understood 
everything.  I want them to have a real competent understanding at some 
level of a certain subset of the course material.  I also usually have 
my exams include both in-class problems and take-home problems, and the 
take-home problems are, of course, all individual on the exams.  I do 
that because I want to optimize their chance to perform well and the time 
pressure of a 50 minute class is just sometimes not amicable to doing a 
good job.  It certainly is not a good environment for doing an open ended 
question or a longer type of question.   <P>

So here is just one example of a question I made up for my operating 
systems class.  I asked "Suppose you are to design an operating system for 
a computer that has no clock and no interrupt hardware.  Discuss how your 
operating system could support the services listed below."  When I
first used this question, that was the whole question on the exam 
[without enumerating specific services] and I found that with such an 
open ended question I got so many answers going off in so many directions 
that it was very hard to grade.  I ended up refining it with guidelines 
later and that's going to be one of my hints for managing your time in 
writing and grading exams: Focus it so that you get an answer going in 
the direction that you want it to go.  So these are some suggestions 
for writing exams that are easier to grade and that focus the 
student's attention.  The other thing is to write questions that are not 
too hard to answer nor too hard to grade.  I always tell students to write 
down their assumptions if there is something that they don't understand 
on an exam question.   <P>

I often provide a templet for the problem.  Here is a question that was 
on one of my early exams when I first started teaching as a new assistant
professor. I wrote "Define internal and external fragmentations that
can occur due to memory management schemes."  Again I got answers going 
all over the place -- some people left out some of the memory management 
schemes all together and others addressed all of them, so it was hard 
to grade uniformly.  Later on I made the question have an answer format 
with boxes that guided them to what I wanted to come out.  Also with these 
boxes I could really grade the answers quickly.  Now you do loose something 
when you structure the questions that tightly.  The students don't have to
organize their answer and decide what are the important issues in the 
answer.  This, then goes back to writing exams with a variety of questions.  
You want some of the questions designed for the ease of grading but you 
still want to leave some where you are telling them that their structuring 
of the answer is part of a good answer.   <P>

I have found that as I grade exams, I learn how to improve the questions.  
I recycle my exam questions to homework questions in following years so 
I find ways to improve on the exams.  I give the same homework assignment 
again and I refine it each year.  Of course, it's very useful if you can 
write out all the solutions yourself and then have the teaching assistant
take the exam and debug it.  <P>

Here are some general guidelines for saving time.  When I first started 
teaching I contacted a number of faculty at other universities who had 
taught the same courses and asked for their resources.  I was able to
utilize a lot of those and they were very helpful.  I recycle old questions 
and reuse them year after year.  You need to try to cope with the time 
demands of teaching.  Lecture preparations are very time consuming so
you just need to cut it at some point.  One way to deal with that
is to ask to teach the same courses in successive years -- that's very
very helpful and, more than just the time savings, you also you end up 
learning the course material very well.  Ask to teach courses that
support your research.  Don't try to be too ambitious.   People who are 
learning can't learn too much material at once so it turns out you can 
actually go at a slower pace then you initially think you can.  It helps 
both you and the student to not cover too much.  Utilize the resources of 
your teaching assistant.  Sometime you feel like you ought to do it all.  
For grading, I try to give some of it to my assistants.  But it's also
important to try and grade some of the questions so that you know how the 
students are doing.  If necessary, be aggressive -- if the department isn't
giving you enough resources, go ask them for another grader or whatever.  
I guess the last hint I can give is to learn to let go.  You want to do 
an excellent job but sometimes the time doesn't permit it.  You don't 
have to be perfect.  And even though in grading I want to do it really 
thoroughly for all the students, I sometime just grade a little
bit more superficially and accept it.  <P>


<DT> <B>Barbara Ryder</B>
<DD> 

I'm Barbara Ryder and I teach in the Computer Science department at
Rutgers University which is the state university of New Jersey.   By
way of introduction, I finished a math degree in '71 and went into
industrial work at Bell Laboratories and subsequently after having two
children went back to graduate school and graduated in '82.  I have
been an academic at Rutgers since then and I am now an associate
professor there.   <P>

We are trying to concentrate on issues of teaching in undergraduate courses.
My job is to try to tell you about teaching in the situation that many of 
us at large public universities find ourselves.  This is teaching courses 
of between 75 and 100 people in a big lecture for three hours a week where 
the students break up into smaller recitation sections of 30 some odd people 
that are taught by graduate students.  I think when you have a large
lecture class the most important thing is to make clear to the students at 
the beginning what their obligations are and what your expectations are.  
The first day they come to class there should be a syllabus with a
tentative outline of the sequence of topics you are going to cover: how 
many exams you are going to have; when they are; any programming 
assignments that are multiweek assignments.  This way the 
students know what their obligation in this whole situation is.  At many 
schools there is sort of a "shopping period" in the first week of class
and your syllabus helps the students to decide how they are going
to balance this class and its obligations verses other classes that
they are taking.  It's also important, as Joan pointed out, not to always 
rely only on the text book for materials.  It's good to start the semester 
out on the right foot by having your extra reserve materials in the library 
ready for the beginning of class.  Also, students can go and look at the 
material and get an idea of the kinds of topics that you are going to cover.   <P>

Now in a large class, no matter how clear and succinct you are at the board, 
if you are trying to write down a program of more than four lines, you 
probably need to have a hand out.  It's very very easy for people to get 
confused and have difficulty with examples that are multiboard examples,
particularly in a large lecture class.   My approach has been to develop a
suite of examples.  You don't walk in Day 1 and have this but as you
begin teaching a course and you ask colleagues for their suggestions
when they teach similar courses, you can develop your own suite of examples. <P>

This next point is a little controversial: Encourage effective class
participation.  My colleagues and I don't always agree on this one.
I think you can teach a large lecture class and also allow and encourage
questions from the students.  In general having questions from the
students is the only way you can tell that you are getting your points
across.  You will have eye contact with only the first three rows in
the class.  That means the vast majority of the students are out there 
and you can't really tell whether the points you are trying to make 
are being understood.  (And generally the same kids sit in the first 
three rows.)  There are several ways to try to set up a classroom  
atmosphere that encourages questions.  For one, you have to be patient 
enough to wait for the students to get up the courage to shout out an 
answer.  This gets better later on in the term after the students are 
used to you, but they tend to be very shy initially.  When you do get 
an answer, it's very important to avoid replies that make students look 
unknowledgeable or foolish.  This is what students worry about in these 
large classes.  They're willing to go on the edge if there's in a group 
of 10 doing homework, but not when there are a hundred people.  Similarly, 
when you get a question from the floor, try not to bite off the student's 
head if the question is inappropriate.  If you can manage to make 
your class nonconfrontational, you will get participation.  <P>

And finally, do motivating examples. I teach by example and, in general, I 
think most of us do.  It's important not to just lecture about ideas but 
to show people ideas in the context of some kind of example.   <P>

Two things that I put under logistics but that could have been under 
problems just as well are grading and project courses.  Assigning grades is 
really very difficult to do.  It's difficult to do because we know it
means a lot to the students, it's difficult to be fair, and it's difficult 
in the beginning to know how to be consistent when you haven't done it 
before.  What you have to try to do is set some standards for yourself and
try to keep to them.  The most important standard is defining
what is a passing grade in your class.  You will have to decide at the 
end of the term, when you've totaled up all the tests and the projects 
and the homeworks and everything else, what does it take to pass the 
class.  That's really the most important decision; not who gets the A's 
and who gets the B's.  It matters to people's cumulative average, but the 
important decision is who passes the class.  And you should ONLY consider
a student's performance in the one particular class, not whether or not
getting a D or an F in this class will get a student kicked out of school
or cause the loss of a scholarship or anything else.  Many of us have
rules of thumb that we use, but this is not something that people take 
lightly so be ready.  <P>

Project courses. There are a lot of aspects of courses that deal with 
computer projects that make them somewhat different from a pure lecture 
class. Let me just highlight one of these.  The important thing in a 
project class is not to give a monolithic project to a group of 
undergraduates and tell them it is due at the end of the term.  That is 
death.  Uniformly, you will have people who will never finish.  Uniformly, 
you will have people who don't even know how to get started. So in a 
project course, what you really have to do is break the project into 
logical pieces and give people some guidance as to how to start designing, 
particularly, the beginning pieces.  You will find that when you give 
realistic timetables, you can do some kind of coordination with what's 
expected of the students in their other courses.  Projects are also a
good mechanism for students to work on their communication skills.  Having
them document their projects or give oral presentations, 
aids them in terms of developing skills that industry looks for when they 
get out. <P>

Let's spend a little time on problems that you may have to deal with.  One
is handling questions in class. I guess the thing that's most important in
handling questions in front of any size class is knowing that saying, "I 
don't know." is not a cop-out. The important thing that you learn after
you get over the fear of facing a hundred bodies and trying to present
some material and to interest them in the material, is that the students
will ask questions that you may not have an on-the-fly answer for.
The appropriate response is to say "I'm not sure." or "I don't know."
and immediately to come back in the next lecture with an answer. So in
that way it's not like you're showing vulnerability; you don't get
negative points for being unprepared. There are questions that come
out of left field that you can't always handle. Also, make sure you 
understand the question and make sure all the people in the class
understand the question before you start answering it. <P>

Another problem is handling your own mistakes.  Just as in the
other situation, I think quick feedback is the key to handling 
something you have said that is not true or was said by mistake. Many of 
us make little glitches in our teaching and the important thing is to be 
honest with people because they know you've made the mistake. You're not 
fooling anybody and so the best recovery is to be honest about it. <P>

Let me talk a little on cheating because this is really a large problem 
in many of our lives.  Cheating exists.  I don't think there's any way 
to get rid of it but there are, shall we say, strategies to try to 
control the opportunity students have for cheating.  These are some of 
the things that I do.  I give all open book exams.  It's true I teach 
upper division courses, juniors and seniors, but I give open book exams. 
Well that cuts out cheat sheets and all that kind of stuff and it also, 
unfortunately, puts a burden on me to make harder questions because you 
can't give regurgitation questions on open book exams.  So you have to 
come up with these integrative questions that Ginnie talked about 
that make people think and that are tough enough.  Cheating on 
homeworks?  Well one thing you can do is to always model one or two of 
the problems on your exams from the homeworks.  Then you know the people 
that didn't really do their homework, no matter what they got as a 
homework grade.  You make it hurt them later as it were; crime 
doesn't pay is kind of my philosophy on this.  On programming assignments, 
this is much harder.  In the days of text processors it's fairly easy to 
change variables and to change indentation.  When you or a TA is looking 
at a programming assignment and there's a very bizarre programming error 
that comes up in two assignments out of the thirty or forty, it certainly 
becomes obvious that in the least, these people talked about the design 
of their program.   Your recourse in such cases should be decided ahead
of time and told to the students up front.  What you decide to do finally
should be based on your personal feelings as well as any departmental or 
university policies.   <P>

We'll take some questions now and then add a couple of wrap-up comments
at the end. <P>


<DT> <B>Question</B>
<DD> 

This is on cheating and is a slightly long-winded question,
but one thing I like to do is give solutions.  And in context let me say 
I'm working at a sophomore level; algorithms and data structures. I like
to give out solutions and I have a lot of students who really say this
helps. And I give out solutions when the homeworks are due. I don't
take late assignments. That makes it easy because the solutions are
right there. I also like to reuse questions. I've made some questions that
I like and so I reuse these questions.  The answers are noticeable better
the second time around and it's clear the students got the solutions from 
someone else.  Related to that, I ask students not to collaborate on 
homeworks but they do anyhow.  At times it's obvious.  Yes, I do sort of 
check them on the exams but I have this problem -- if you weight the 
homeworks enough, they spend a lot of time on it but then if you weight 
them too much then the cheaters get by.  If you weight them too little 
the people who work hard and are really bad exam takers have trouble 
How does one combine all these things?  I don't think there's an easy 
answer to the problem of cheating.  And I also don't think 
that as a university professor I should be a policewoman, frankly.
I don't want to make it easy for people to get away with not doing the 
work by themselves and I don't want people to steal other peoples' answers.
But I'm only willing to go so far in the pursuit of crime at the university.  <P>


<DT> <B>Answer </B>
<DD> 
You've raised some reasonable issues.  You might want to have some 
discussions with the other people in your department.  Sometimes the 
department will have a general philosophy about what is considered illegal 
collaboration and what is not. In our department we have a strong policy 
that there's to be no collaboration tolerated. If anybody
gets caught then they flunk that class. A notice is written out. They
aren't expelled or anything from school but a notice is sent all the
way up to the Dean of Students.  We do that because we want to see 
that if they're cheating in other classes too it gets heard. But all 
schools don't do that and sometimes when you send a cheating case up 
to the Dean of Students and then you go into a disciplinary committee 
hearing, you always lose the case because people in other disciplines 
don't understand what is cheating on an assignment.  Talk to some other 
people in your department and at least try and get some consistency. 
It might be something that could be brought up in curriculum committee 
discussions so that there can be some consistency.  As for reusing 
questions, students definitely will network and get ahold of previous
semester tests and assignments.  And when students are under a lot of
pressure, which they are most of the time, it is very hard for them not
to make use of that information. <P>


<DT> <B>Janie Irwin</B>
<DD> 
Well this isn't a question. This is an advertisement for a project
that CRA has just started. We're working on putting together a
collection of Master Teacher tapes which are to be used by first and
second year assistant professors just getting started. There was
an advertisement that went around to your department heads for the
four Master Teacher tapes. This is a project that was started by Dave
Patterson at Berkeley. I would highly recommend that you go and
see if your department head has ordered them.  They're $300 dollars a 
class and you get four to five tapes.  They're not to be used in place 
of you in class.  What they're to be used for is for you to take them 
home and see how a master teacher presents that material: the pace that 
is used; the style used.  The four tapes are Manny Blum in algorithms, 
junior, senior level; John Ousterhout on operating systems; Dave Patterson 
in architecture; and Randy Katz in logic design, a sophomore level course. 
We're hoping to add to this set and we're hoping that you can use it to 
spend less time on preparation and still come out with nice teaching 
evaluations. <P>


<DT> <B>Question</B>
<DD> 
I'd like some suggestions on how to teach courses in which there's a broad
range of abilities between the students. How do you challenge the best
students in the course and how much time and effort do you spend on
the students at the bottom?  I try to accommodate all of them. I have
extra credit questions for the more able students and then I do 
help sessions for students who are struggling. I actually have make-up 
mid-terms to give people a second chance. If they have flubbed it,
they come to a help session and then they get a chance to do it
again. But, that's all extra time.   <P>


<DT> <B>Answer</B>
<DD> 
 Again the reward is internal. You don't get credit for it; it
takes your time but I find it quite rewarding even to work with the slower
students; to have them actually come up to speed and maybe turn out not 
to be a slow student after all.  You have a fine line here too because 
some students are not adequately prepared to be in this field.  You also 
need to have some awareness of what the standards are in your department 
as to what passing is so that you aren't always just doing a bell curve 
on whatever distribution you get in your class.  Office hours can also
be used effectively to help out students.  It's relatively important to 
be there for all the students in the class so that the people who feel 
they do need extra help can avail themselves of basically one-on-one 
tutoring during your office hours. Another good teaching tip is to
run review sessions before the hourlys and before the final. Not in
class time but in extra time because you can't afford to give up the
class time. You usually have too much to get into the lectures.  But these
things really help the students organize their studying and figure out
a structure to outline what it is you've tried to give
them.  It also gives them some insight into the kind of problems you're
thinking about and what might be on the test.  This really helps those 
students whose skills at taking classes and absorbing the material are 
not as strong. <P>


<DT> <B>Question</B>
<DD> 
I just finished my first term at teaching and I found it a rather 
grueling experience. I learned a lot and the next time I teach it will 
be much better, I'm sure.  But a couple of points of advice for new 
teachers that I'd recommend is that they try to get a smaller size course 
with fewer students, and also try not to teach a required course so that
the course is not filled with students who don't want to take that course. 
I also have a question that hasn't really been addressed. I taught two 
sections of the same course and one of those classes became quite 
antagonistic and obnoxious.  There was a lot of background noise in the 
back of the room and it wasn't until later when individual students 
approached me and apologized for the class in general, that I found that 
it was really more against me than anything else.  What I didn't learn 
is how to control a mass movement like that at an early enough stage to 
prevent things from getting out of hand.  I think I could probably 
recognize it but what should I do about it? <P>


<DT> <B>Answer </B>
<DD> 
There's no easy answer to that -- different things work for different
people and sometimes it seems you just can't connect with a class no
matter what you do.  I think, however, that the earlier you are able 
to recognize that things are going in a weird direction, the easier it
is to take care of.  As you said, the ability to recognize the 
situation comes with experience.  One thing that you can try if this
happens again is when you think someone or some group is talking too
much in class you just stop and you say "Is there something you wanted 
to say to the class?"  You don't have to be ugly about it but you can 
still call their attention, in a nonconfrontational way, to let them know:
"I know you're doing that and we're going to stop if that's what you're 
going to do.  I'm not just going to keep talking louder and louder to
try and talk over you."  In general, students will get upset when they 
aren't getting their money's worth.  They might not say that to you
and they may even be laughing at the one who's being disruptive, but they 
really don't appreciate that.  When you are able to get your point
across to the disruptive ones, again in a nonconfrontational way, then
the others will often put on some peer pressure if it happens again.
One more thing.  As a teacher you try to be friendly with your students
and show them that you're on their side, but at the same time you must
be their judge and evaluator.   Being too much on either side can have
bad repercussions. <P>


<DT> <B>Joan Francioni</B>
<DD> 
Let me make a few closing remarks.  We want to stress to you that you
should make an effort to be considerate of your students and also true to 
yourself.  Maintain a reasonable pace for yourself and your students.  
Recognize that you both have lives outside of school.  Capitalize on 
your strengths and adjust for your weaknesses.  Everybody has both and
you can really find out a lot about what's working, as well as what needs 
to be worked on, by reading the student comments on your evaluations.
And finally, treat your students with the respect that you want them to 
treat you with.  If you don't then you will always have conflicts. 
But if you do -- it just goes a long way when you let them know that you 
think that they're important as well.  <P>

It's a great profession, and I wish you all the best!
