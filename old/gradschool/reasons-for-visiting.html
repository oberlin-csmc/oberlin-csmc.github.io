<H1>Reasons for Visiting Grad Schools that Accept you</H1>
</center>
Hopefully by the time you're thinking about visiting a school, you've
already discovered that there are people there doing research which
interests you. One important aspect of visiting a school is meeting
those people. They are all potential dissertation advisors, and it's a
good idea to find out if you can get along with them. Try to make sure
that the people who interest you most will be around so you can talk
with them when you visit.  <P>

Even if you don't get the chance to meet potential advisors, you will
learn alot by visiting a school. It's just not possible to get a feel
for a place from a brochure or a web page. And there's many <A

answered remotely.
