I recently wrote a paper called "How to Succeed in Graduate School:  A
Guide for Students and Advisors," that is publicly available on the
net.  (The original version of the paper was called, "How to Be a Good
Graduate Student / Advisor.")  It contains a lot of suggestions on
finding an advisor and a thesis topic, doing research, writing the
thesis, and establishing a research network, among other things.

The latest version of the paper is available by ftp at ftp.erg.sri.com.
There is a latex file (advice.tex), with two additional input files
(advice.bbl, the BibTeX bibliography, and named.sty, a bibliography
style file), and a postscript version (advice.ps).  To get the
paper:
    ftp to ftp.erg.sri.com, login as anonymous, and give your
    	e-mail address as the password
    'cd pub/advice'
    use the 'get' command to take whichever files you want.
To generate the latex output, copy the first three files, run
'latex advice,' then 'bibtex advice,' then latex twice more
to incorporate all of the references.

An HTML version of the original paper can be found at:
    http://www.cs.indiana.edu/HTMLit/how.2b/how.2b.html
U. Indiana's "What Every New Grad Student Should Know," which points
to this HTML version as well as Phil Agre's networking paper and other
useful resources, is at:
    http://www.cs.indiana.edu/docproject/grad.stuff.html

The paper will be published in two parts in issues 1.2 and 1.3 of
Crossroads, the online ACM student magazine.  The Crossroads home page
is at
        http://info.acm.org/crossroads/
        gopher://info.acm.org/11[the_files.pubs.magazines.crossroads]
        ftp://info.acm.org/pubs/magazines/crossroads/

The paper will also be reprinted in an upcoming issue of the IAPPP
(International Amateur-Professional Photoelectric Photometry)
Communications, and in a shorter form in Vivek, an India-based
quarterly in AI. 

Some of the references in the paper are incomplete (or possibly
incorrect). If anyone has more complete bibligraphic information for
any of the references, I'd appreciate it if you would send it to me.
Comments and feedback on the paper are also very welcome.
