<H2>Purpose and Intentions of this Document</H2>

<P>All users of the CS computer system have a right to privacy of their
data, and to use of the system resources for educational purposes.  The
primary goal of this document is to ensure these rights by keeping
users from violating others' privacy, and from corrupting or damaging
data or resources.  All specific rules and points should be interpreted
with this in mind.  There will be separate documents maintained listing
resource usage guidelines for CS systems, as well as appropriate
behavior in CS laboratories.  Nothing in this document shall be construed 
as replacing any established rules appertaining to conduct of members of 
the Oberlin College community.

<H2>I. System Security</H2>

<P>1.  Gaining unauthorized access to the system is prohibited. 
Unauthorized access is defined as reading, writing, executing, or
otherwise accessing files, or other resources,that a properly
functioning computer system wouldn't allow a user with the access
permissions given to you by the system administrators to access.

<P>2. Before running a program whose intended purpose is to gain
unauthorized access to the system, or to gain other system users'
passwords [eg. a password cracking program], users are required to get
the permission of the system administrators.

<P>3.  Users may not let anyone else use their account, unless the other
person is being directly supervised by the account owner.

<P>4.  Users must choose safe passwords, and are responsible for ensuring
file protections are set correctly.

<P>5. Users shouldn't intentionally damage other people's files, or trick
them into running a program unintentionally.  For example, a fake 'ls'
in your directory that does an 'rm *.*', or mails you the executing
users ~/mail,  would be prohibited.

<P>6. At times, it may be necessary for the system administrators to deny
users access to the system in order to prevent an imminent threat to
the system.  This should be done only when absolutely necessary, and
appropriate adjudicatory processes should be initiated as soon as
possible to make a final decision.  The system administrators should
never deny access to a user as a punitive measure, but only to
forestall damage to the system until the issue can be dealt with by the
appropriate adjudicatory processes.


<H2>II. Resource Usage</H2>

<P>1.   Users should comply with the system resource usage guidelines set
by the system administrator.  These guidelines will be written down in
another document of "System Resource Usage Guidelines".  In general,
users should refrain from using extra-ordinarily large amounts of
system resources (disk, CPU) without consulting with the sysadmin.
Resource consumption should be minimized according to the measures in
the System Resource Usage Guidelines. If the system administrator needs
to kill a running process, the admin should make a serious effort to
contact the user first, especially if the user is online at the time. 
If it's necessary to kill a process without contacting the user first,
the user should be notified afterwards of what processes were killed,
and why.

<P>2.  Recreational or non-educational use of CS computer systems is
acceptable, as long as it doesn't interfere with the academic and
educational mission of the College and the CS computer systems.

<P>3. Any program implementing a network service accessible remotely (eg.
MUDs or BBSs) should be cleared with the system administrator before
being started.  If such services do not use unacceptably large amounts
of system resources or otherwise interfere with the system, and do not
compromise system security, they will be approved.


<H2>III. Illegal Use</H2>

<P>1. Users may not use the Oberlin CS systems as a launching platform in
order to break into any other system, or to perform illegal activities
(including software piracy and illegal harassment).

<H2>IV. Privacy and Account Searches</H2>

<P>1.  Access to protected and private files and resources without the
knowledge and consent of the owner is permitted when there is probable
cause to suspect the existence of contraband or crime, or the violation
of system, departmental, or college rules.  All such searches will
comply with the following regulations: 
<UL>
<LI>A. Users will be notified by
email and/or standard mail 24 hours in advance of the search, or by
hand delivered notice served prior to the search.  Students must be
given the option of being present when the search occurs, or having a
witness authorized by the student present. 

<LI>B. All searches are to be
authorized by the director of the CS program and the Dean of the
College or his/her designee in advance, and in writing. 

<LI>C. General
searches are prohibited, and may not be authorized. Authorization for a
search should include the specific files or directories to be searched,
who those files are owned by, and the object of the search. 

<LI>D. The
system administrator may not remove any files without the permission of
the user, with the exceptions of illegally copied software and specific
files which the system administrator has significant reason to believe
contain information which is a threat to system security.  Removed
files should be kept in a secure area until it is well established that
the file was placed on the system in violation of system rules. 

<LI>E. If a
search has not complied with these regulations, College or Departmental
judicial action may not be taken against the user on the basis of
evidence discovered during the search, and evidence discovered may not
be used in any judicial hearing.
</UL>

<P>2.  There may be cases where an imminent threat to the system requires
an administrator to access protected or private files and resources
immediately, without complying with the above regulations.  It is
recognized that this may sometimes be the case, but administrators
should adhere to as many of the above regulations as judged possible in
a given situation, and unless all of the above regulations are adhered
to, no evidence discovered may be used in, or serve as the basis of,
any College or Departmental judicial action.  After such action has
been taken, a full report will be given, including exactly what files
or resources were accessed, and what the reasons requiring the access
were.  This report will be made available to the owner of the files
that were accessed.

<H2>V. Freedom of Expression</H2>

<P>1.  The Computer Science systems are a free and open forum for
expression, including viewpoints that are strange, unorthodox, or 
unpopular. No official  sanctions will be placed upon the expression of
personal opinion on the network. Users are free from censorship in 
expressing their views, as long as their views are not  represented as
the views of Oberlin College. Users should be aware that many of the
laws which apply to other media also apply to electronic
communications, and users are responsible for acting according to
applicable laws.

<P>2.  Oberlin cannot prevent its users from receiving harassing or
unwanted, unsolicited communications from outside of the Oberlin
community. If a user receives harassing or unwanted, unsolicited
communications, the matter may be referred to the appropriate College or
Civil authorities. Users should be aware, however, that there are
many services on the Internet that might be considered offensive to
groups of users, and therefore network users must take responsibility
for their own navigation of the network.

<P>3. Users have the right to use methods available to them to send email,
or otherwise communicate, anonymously. This right does not include the
right to forge messages, that is to try to make a message appear as if
it were written by someone other then the true author, but only
includes the right to obscure identity with anonymity or pseudonymity.
Users shall not be punished for obscuring their identity in electronic
communications.  If a user is caught breaking a rule under cover of
anonymity, the penalties shall not be increased because of the use of
anonymity.

<H2>VI. Judgement Processes/Due Process/Something Like That</H2>

<P>This section hasn't been written yet, because we decided to first get
all of the actual rules set down and agreed upon, and then figure out
what the appropriate existing college processes are (J-Board, etc.). 
But this is here to remind us that we've got to deal with this
eventually.
