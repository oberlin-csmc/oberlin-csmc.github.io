SYSTEM RULES DOCUMENT Version 1.0

rules document (jstarmer, jelharou, rsadek, and rhys

This document describes rules for those using the computer science
network.  This network exists to support the academic program;
other uses are secondary.  The basic guide is to use the system with a
thought to the needs of others.  Many new users of this system have
never thought in terms of multiuser systems before.  File space, CPU
time and other resource that you take up are not available to other
users.  Think before you do things that might affect others on the
system. <P>

If you have any questions or problems with this document, you can address questions
to any CS faculty, the system manager, or CSMC. <P>

<LI>    When rebooting a machine, use the proper procedure and do not
hard reboot (i.e. don't just press the reset button).

<LI>    Do not install licensed software onto any of the Computer
Science machines without prior approval of the systems administrator.
To do so otherwise is strictly forbidden.

<LI> 
	You are responsible for anything that happens through your 
	account.  Never leave an X server unattended.  If you must
	leave the lab briefly, use the xlock program to lock your
	console. If you leave the lab for more than 15 minutes, LOG
	OUT. NEVER leave your X server unattended without xlock;
	i.e. DO NOT USE stuff like xmessage.  
<LI> 
	Be aware that accidental spills of drinks and beverages could destroy a 
	machine.  Any food must be kept away from the keyboards and
	you must clean up after yourself.  The lounge area is a much
	better place to eat than the lab.

<LI> 	Keep the lab clean and organized.  Throw out scratch paper,
	candy wrappers, etc., put away your books, before you leave! 

<LI> 	Be considerate of others.  This is a work area.  Do not play
	music if anyone objects to it.

<LI> 	Refrain from any offensive behavior that might interfere with
	other's work

<LI> 	Refrain from any offensive behavior that might interfere with
	other's work.  This includes downloading and/or viewing pornography.

<LI> 	Only CS students and those specificly authorized are allowed
	to use the lab.  If you see people in the lab who shouldn't be
	there, politely ask them to move on.

<LI> 	Do not turn off any CS equipment except in the case of a dire 
	emergency. Contact an upper-level student if you need help 
	unfreezing a machine. 

<LI> 	Game playing has the lowest priority for machine usage.  If 
	you are playing a game and someone else needs your station for 
	work, you must yield to them. Games not involving computers 
	should not be played in the lab.

<LI> 	Do not play X games on occs. 

<LI> 	Long-running jobs should be niced to 19, and the system
	manager should be informed of them. 

<LI> 	You may not let anyone else use your account, unless you are 
	directly supervising them. 

<LI> 	You may not use the system as a launching platform in order to 
	break into any other system, to steal software, or to perform
	any illegal activity. 

<LI> 	Any network service, and anything that might compromise system 
	security. must be cleared by the system manager before being
	started. 

<LI> 	You may not run processes on faculty machines without the
	express permission of the faculty member in question. 

<LI> 	You may not create a world-writable directory. 

<LI> 	Passwords should contain no proper names, at least one number,
	letter, and punctuation symbol. The more esoteric the better.

<LI> 	Heavy i/o jobs should be run on occs. 

<LI> 	Do not hog system resources unnecessarily. 

<LI> 	If something strange happens on any CS equipment, send mail to 
	the system manager describing what happened in
	complete detail so that he can take action.  

<LI> 	Please notify the system manager if you no longer need your
	account.  

<LI> 	Directory trees should not be nested excessively.  While this 
	is not likely to happen in practice, there has been at least
	one instance of a highly nested frivolous directory tree
	construction causing the automatic reboot process to be
	aborted requiring manual intervention and adversely affecting
	the system's return to working status.
