<H3>Regarding: Departmental Hiring Policies</H3>
<H3>Date: October 13, 1994</H3>

We are concerned about the way that students are hired for positions
within the computer science department.  All too often, it seems that
the decision to hire a student depends upon the student's "networking"
skills rather than the student's ability to do the work well.  We
would like to suggest a few guidelines and ideas for student hiring
that we hope will be followed in the future. <P>

<UL>
<LI> 
All positions should be publicly advertised, at least by a post to
msgs.  However, because not everyone reads msgs, it would be very
useful to also have a bulletin board in the King lab and a newsgroup
(oberlin.jobs.offered? or we could create oberlin.cs.jobs.offered)
where open student positions are posted regularly. <P>

<LI> 
Whenever possible, positions for the next semester should be
advertised at least before the end of the current semester.
Otherwise, it is difficult for students to plan their job schedules.
This is especially a problem for students who need to make a certain
amount of money each semester due to financial issues.  If they can't
count on a cs job, they have to go and get a job at cds (or somewhere
else), only to find out a few weeks later that there is a job offered
in cs that they would have been perfect for.  This also means that a
professor is not looking for a grader at the last minute, and
assignments can get graded on time even at the beginning of the
semester. <P>

<LI> 
There should be a reasonable time between when a job offer is
posted and when the decision to hire is made - a week at minimum would
be a good guideline.  Otherwise, students are not given enough time to
decide whether the job fits in with their schedule, etc.  It would be
a benefit both to the students and the department if hiring were merit
based, rather than first come first serve. <P>
