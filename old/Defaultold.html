The csmc plans cs parties, makes t-shirts, sponsors cs lunches, and
holds discussions about what is going on in the cs department.  We
meet at 8:00pm on Thursdays in the King lounge (bi-weekly so far).  Join us if you have
something you'd like us to discuss or if you'd just like to get
involved. We're here to address any concerns you may have with the
department.  If you'd like us to discuss something, but you can't make
it to a meeting, please feel free to <a href="mailto:csmc@cs.oberlin.edu">send csmc email</a>, or talk with one of the regular members. (Hopefully, we will soon have a list here.)

Student Job Opportunities
</A>
</H3> 
The Computer Science Department faculty have given us descriptions of
all of the jobs available for the coming semester. These are great
learning opportunities, they bring in money, and they look good on
your resume. Plus, in most cases you get the satisfaction of helping
your fellow students out. Generally, these are grading and lab assistent jobs and
most have been filled.  There is currently an opening for grading <a href=""
"http://www.cs.oberlin.edu/classes/cs331">Compilers (cs331)</a>.  See or email 
<a href="mailto:jll@cs.oberlin.edu">Julia Lawall</a> for details.
