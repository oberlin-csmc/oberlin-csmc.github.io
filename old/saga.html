<h3>This is a description of what has happened to the idea of getting
keys for CS majors over the years.   by David Hersey 2/18/89. </h3></center>
<hr><P>


    Several years ago, an effort was made to develop a way for computer 
science students to get into the King lab when the building is closed.  This
resulted in security issuing building passes to students.  The inconvenience 
of this was that students had to call security to get in, and wait around
outside for a while until security showed up. <P>


    In January 1989, I contacted various people in the college administration
and wound up talking to Diana Roose, who is a associate dean in Cox.
I submitted to her <A HREF="keyproposal.html">this proposal</A>
 and she liked the
idea.  She asked me to get a cover letter from Rich Salter, and she would try
to get the thing past Security for us.   <P>

    The CS faculty met to discuss the proposal, and decided not to endorse
it.  The reason:  There are at least ten departments in King and Rice, which
are the buildings that keys would give us unrestricted access to.  Even though
they keep their departments locked when the building is closed, we would still
need their consent if we were to be issued keys.   Some of these departments
have complained about us being in the building under the pass system, and they
might see this as an opportunity to challenge this system in addition to
vetoing the key request. <P>

    Basically, it looks like we are lucky to have access to King at all,
and that it is still a tenuous situation.  It is a hassle to wait to get in,
and it is a hassle for security.  The system would not work at all if there
were not the tacit understanding that we routinely let each other in to the
building, but nothing like that could ever be in writing officially.  As long
as we maintain our discretion, things should continue working as they are.
Someday when we get our own building on campus, we can talk about getting keys
for CS majors, because it will just be the CS department in there.  For now, I
guess we have to keep throwing rocks at the windows.... <P>
