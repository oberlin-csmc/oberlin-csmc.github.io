<center><u>Oberlin College Computer Science Majors' Committee Charter</u>
<p>
<p> 
<p> 
<u>Purpose & Responsibilities</u></center></font>
<p>
<p> 
The Computer Science Majors' Committee goals and responsibilities include, 
but are not limited to:<br>
<blockquote>
1. Serving as a representative body, in the program and in the college,
for Computer Science Majors and students.<br>

2. Making use policy for the CS labs (games, noise, food, etc.)<br>

3. Bolstering the Oberlin Computer Science Community through activities,
T-shirts, and special events (unix/emacs night, games night, CS tea, etc)<br>
<p></blockquote>
<center><u><font size=5>Membership</u></center><p> </font>
<p> 

The official membership of the Computer Science Majors' Committee
comprises Computer Science majors who have either been elected to the
committee at the beginning of the current year, or who have been elected
to fill a vacated position in the course of the year. In either case, the
tenure of membership is restricted to the duration of the current academic
year. <p>

<b>Requirements for membership:</b><br>
<blockquote>
1. Members must be declared CS majors.<br>

2. Members must attend all CSMC meetings.  A member who is absent from
three meetings becomes "inactive" and may be removed from the CSMC by
unanimous agreement among all active members.<br>
</blockquote>
In addition, members are expected to participate in the activities of the
CSMC. <p>

<center><font size=5><u>Membership elections at the beginning of the year</u></center></font>
<p> 
<p> 
An election will be held within two weeks of the first day of classes of
each year to determine that year's initial membership.  Any declared CS
major may nominate them-self or any other CS student, and voting will be 
open to all CS students.  A student volunteer who is not a candidate will 
run the election, which will be conducted by standard majority voting.  
First, a senior or fifth year "head" of CSMC will be elected.  Then, 
another "head" will be elected from any class.  Two senior/fifth year 
members will be elected next, followed by two junior member, then two 
underclass members.  If there are few enough candidates in a particular 
category to create a "shoo-in" situation, the position is opened up for 
all classes to nominate candidates.  If someone has reason to count 
themselves among two different classes, they may run for either position 
but not both. <p>

If a position on the committee is vacated for any reason, the CSMC will
call another election to elect a replacement as soon as is feasible. <p>

<u><center><font size=5>Meetings</u></center></font>
<p> 
<p> 
The CSMC will hold no closed meetings unless such a meeting is mandated by
the CS faculty for a particular purpose, or the CSMC decides in advance
that a meeting should be closed.  In general, all CS students are welcome
to attend all meetings of the CSMC, regardless of whether they are
declared CS majors. <p>

<u><center><font size=5>Publishing of information </u></center></font>
<p> 
<p> 
The CSMC will post its membership to msgs after the initial election,
and again after any change to its membership. <br>

The CSMC will publicly publish important notes from any public meetings. <p>

<u><center><font size=5>Amendments to this document</u></center></font>
<p> 
<p> 
Any proposed amendment to this charter must be announced seven days
before it is to be voted upon.  An amendment will be accepted if it is
approved by two-thirds of those declared CS majors voting on it. <p>
