<H1>Proposal for CS Department Mentoring System</H1>
<hr>
</center>
<H2>Purpose</H2>
To facilitate communication and information sharing between early
(CS 151) students and people who know their way around the system; provide
another mechanism for new students to learn. <P>

<H2>Becoming involved</H2>
<UL>
<LI> 
  People can voluntarily sign up to be mentors or mentees; the system will
  be on a volunteer basis only. <P>
<LI> 
  Mentors will be assigned mentees by random assignment. <P>
  If there are more mentees than mentors, a given mentor may be assigned
  more than one mentee, but only if the mentor has indicated that this would
  be acceptable. <P>
<LI> 
  If there are more mentors than mentees, some mentors will not be assigned
  specific mentees. This does not preclude them from participating in the
  program. <P>
</UL>

<H2>Informing people of the system, and expectations</H2>
<UL>
<LI> 
  A one-page handout, "How to be a mentor", should be produced. Basically,
  it should give the basics of how not to blow people away with too much
  information at one time. <P>
<LI> 
  Another one-page handout, "What to expect from your mentor", should also
  be produced. Basically, it should say that your mentor won't do your
  homework for you, will answer any CS-related question otherwise, etc. <P>
<LI> 
  A representative of the CSMC or Mentoring group should go in to 151 
  classes and make an announcement that the system is available, giving 
  a brief description. <P>
<LI> 
  msgs should also be employed as a way to encourage people to sign up to
  be mentors or mentees. <P>
</UL>

<H2>Introducing Mentors to Mentees</H2>
<UL>
<LI> 
  A meeting/party should be held once assignments have been made, and all
  Mentors and Mentees should be encouraged to attend. The idea here is not
  only to introduce specific mentor/mentee pairs to each other, but also to
  promote mixing between the groups and to let mentees know which other
  mentoring people are available for questions. <P>
</UL>

<H2>Mentoring Coordinator</H2>
<UL>
<LI> 
  Someone will be responsible for coordinating this, mostly at the beginning
  making assignments, etc.
