After discussing the issue of accessibilty of CS courses the following
issues were raised: <P>

<OL>
<LI> 
There are too many people in many of the courses this semester.
This makes it easy for students to fall through the cracks, hard for
them to get the resources they need such as tutors and computer
access. Classes mentioned were 135, 364(AI), and other courses that
have large enrollment.  <P>

<LI> 
There have been conflicts between CS courses and math courses (this
is bad since many CS majors have a high interest in math and sometimes
double major. Also people having trouble deciding between the 2 depts
may not have a choice if they can't try out both). For example, this
semester, Calc II conflicted with one of the Computer Science courses.
Also, last semester Advanced Calculus conflicted with Compilers. Since
upper level CS courses are only taught every 2 years conflicts like
this are a real problem. <P>

<LI> 
There is insufficient equipment. There are times when every single
terminal is in use and more poeple arrive. We have out of date
equipment taking up space that almost no-one uses and not enough of
the equipment that people need to complete their coursework. Even the
best equipment available for large scale use is between 3-6 years out
of date. <P>
</OL>

These were the major issues that related to the accesibility of
Computer Science courses and we are hopeful that some solution to them
will be forthcoming. Thank you for your time and interest. <P>
