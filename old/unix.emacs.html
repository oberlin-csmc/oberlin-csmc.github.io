<H2>Recommendation Regarding the Teaching of UNIX and EMACS to New Users</H2>
</center>
<hr>
The CSMC would like to recommend that the teaching of basic UNIX and
EMACS commands should be an official part of the introductory (e.g. CS
160) class, such that an adequate amount of time is spent introducing
new students to the system. We suggest that at least one class period
be devoted to in-class coverage of this subject, and that adequate
handouts be provided for the students' reference. It is hoped that by
providing all new students with a basic understanding of how to "get
around" in the system will facilitate their learning of other, more
important computer science concepts, by reducing the amount of time
the new student must spend getting "up to speed" learning practical
day-to-day operations that more experienced users take for granted. <P>
