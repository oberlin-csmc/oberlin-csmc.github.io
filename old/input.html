<HR><ul>
<li> <code>comments = WHY oh WHY are there _three_ courses being advertised as 
introductory computer science courses? _two_ introductory 
one-year sequences?
</code>
<li> <code>name = </code>
<li> <code>classes = op sys
</code>
</ul>
<HR><ul>
<li> <code>comments = I think it's really silly that we have to use a 
_physics_ machine to do these comments. This department is
so security conscious, it's ridiculous. All these restrictions 
don't help security _one bit_...if someone really wants to 
get into the system (why, I don't know...steal some secret 
missile silo plans or something) then they will no matter 
what we do. I think that security should be relaxed and that 
students should be allowed to experiment, make mistakes, 
and _learn_. I mean, this _is_ a college after all, isn't 
it?</code>

<HR><ul>
<li> <code>comments = Why is it that even though there is an official 
prerequsite to cs275 no one in the class has taken
said prerequsite?  I mean, it seems that having a bunch
of unexperienced people in a class like that ruins it
for all the people who HAVE taken the prerequsite.</code>

<li> <code>comments = Why is nobody posting comments to this place anymore?????</code>
<li> <code>name = me</code>

<li> <code>comments = I think it's good that the faculty have decided to 
let us have scripts, but where are they???
</code>
<li> <code>name = </code>
<li> <code>classes = </code>
</ul>
<HR><ul>
<li> <code>comments = In response to the question about the scripts... I wrote
Bob and Rich an email message on Dec. 7 asking what was
up with the public script directory.  Bob responded,
saying he thought we already had what we needed.  I
explained what we needed, and Bob (apparently) emailed
Chuck that evening asking him to give us the public
directory.  So, maybe this is a case of Chuck's just being
real busy, and we'll get our script directory soon.  That's
me being optimistic.  Anyway, I'll check up on it.  (Just
for reference, today's date is Dec. 18.)</code>

<li> <code>classes = none; it's
the end of
the semester!</code>
</ul>
<HR><ul>
<li> <code>comments = Is there a reason why Bob seems _never_ to check his code
before it goes into his lab manual?  In this week's lab,
there are errors in the implementations of BubbleSort and
SelectionSort (I haven't checked the rest), and he gives
incorrect names for two functions which he claims are in a
.h file from which we're supposed to include stuff.  I
just think it's really difficult to learn material if the
profs can't or at least won't get it right in their own 
books.</code>
<li> <code>name = </code>
<li> <code>classes = cs151</code>
</ul>
<HR><ul>
<li> <code>comments = As an Internet Service Provider, I have a job I would like 

to post for graduating seniors in CS. We will need an SE 

with (hopefully) some experience in routers and the Net and

Unix and Macs and NT and Microwave (no, not the kind for 

cheese sandwiches) and anything else useful we can find in 

the gray matter of the intended victim :-)



Seriously, I do need someone.  Please tell me how to get a

job posted.  Steve Mossbrook  oc-alum '68

 computer related job openings for posting here (there).

Regarding the comment made ealier about students in
this class who lack prereques:
If you take a more carefull look, youll see that this
class can also be taken through instructor consent.
This consent can be given for various reasons, including
previous programing experience or AP credit. If someone has a
problem with certian people, that seems to be an issue
to be taken up with profs, but in my experience thoose
of us with out 150, 151 seemed to hold up just fine , at least
if grades are a measrue.</code>
