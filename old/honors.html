<H2>What is Senior Honors?</H2>

Every year a small number of junior computer science majors are
selected to participate in the Honors program.  This program is
campus-wide in the sense that almost every department has some sort of
Honors program, however the organization of a department's program is
left up to the department.  The procedures we will use this year are
essentially the same as those we put into place last year. <P>

Each student participating in the Honors program is required to do two
things:

<OL>
<LI>Engage in a project, sponsored by one or more members of the
faculty, during the school year.  Registration in Honors for 1 to
4 computer science credits per semester is expected to cover the
scope of your effort.  We will have the same expectation of you
regardless of how many hours of credit you sign up for.  Most Honors
students find that their project occupies the bulk of their time for their
entire Senior year.  Project evaluation is based on 
<OL>
<LI>A thesis submitted to your advisor(s) by the end of the second
semester; and
<LI>One or more oral presentations.  We have generally required an
oral "progress report" after the first semester, given to all CS
faculty, to determine whether a student should continue in Honors.
</OL>
<LI>Take an examination at the end of the second semester by an
outside examiner.  The examination usually consists of both written
and oral parts.  The written examination is not based on your project,
but rather covers general knowledge of computer science.  The oral
examination may involve questions on individual projects.
</OL>

Following the outside examination, a designation of Honors, High
Honors, Highest Honors (or no award, which occurs very rarely) is
awarded at graduation.

<H2>How are Honors students selected?</H2>

Students who are interested in participating in the Honors program
will be requested to submit a proposal, outlining a possible Honors
project.  The guideline for minimum overall grade-point average is
3.5, although exceptions may be made.  Your proposal should not be
longer than 1 or 2 pages, and should contain the following information
(in addition to your name):

<OL>
<LI>A title.
<LI>A (possible) faculty sponsor (very helpful but not mandatory).
<LI>A short (1 paragraph) abstract summarizing the problem area, and
what you hope to accomplish.
<LI>A narrative elaborating on the information in the abstract.
You should give enough information about the problem area so that the
goals makes sense.  You  should also discuss methodology (e.g. books
or papers you might use, programs you might write, etc.)  Note,
however, that Honors projects do not have to be original research.
Your methodology can be somewhat vague, but you should try to make
your goal as sharp as possible.  Since goals often change during the
course of research, you will not be held to your stated goal if your
are accepted, but you should at least try to be set forth some initial
ideas about what direction the project will take.  You may present
more than one proposal if you wish, but one good proposal is much more
helpful than several half-baked ones. 
<LI>Any additional information that might help us evaluate your
candidacy for Honors.
<LI>Resources you will require, especially if it includes anything
special.
</OL>

Three factors are weighed heavily in our evaluation of applicants:

<UL>
<LI>The quality of your proposal; whether it is likely to turn into
a successful project.
<LI>Your overall gpa and your performance in CS classes.
<LI>Whether you are likely to benefit from the Honors experience.
</UL>
