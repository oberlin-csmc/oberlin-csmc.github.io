<H2>Starting Out: Where to Apply, How to Do it</H2>
<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="gradschool/where.html">Where to find information about
specific schools or Areas of CS</A> This page also has some
suggestions on how to choose a specific school or area of CS to study
in/at.
<LI> Before you get started on applications, you should have settled
on somewhere between 3 and 7 schools to apply to (about). At least one
of these schools should be a sure thing, and all of them should be
schools you think you can be happy at for 6 years of intensive study
and research. Once you've got your list, you're ready to start applying to grad school:

<H2>The Visit</H2> 

Once you've been accepted by a couple of schools, you'll want to go
and visit them in person. There are many <A
HREF="gradschool/reasons-for-visiting.html">reasons to visit</A> a
school. I've put together a <A

that you may want to try to answer during your visit.

<H2>Getting Funding</H2> 

You're probably a cs major. If you are, there's alot of people out
there who have the silly idea that they want to give money away to
you. You just have to know who to ask. Here's a short list of some of
those <A HREF="gradschool/funding.html">sources of funding</A>. You
might also want to consider applying for some fellowships.

<H2>Some advice that includes (gasp) stuff that happens after you leave grad school</H2>

This space used to hold information from the "CRA Workshop on Academic Careers for Women Held at FCRC, San Diego, May 15 1993." I'm no longer sure where I got the record, and I don't know who made at, and someone pointed out that it might be considered private information. As a result, I've decided to remove it from this page until I can find out if it's ok to have it here.
