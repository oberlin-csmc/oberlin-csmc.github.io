Dear Ms. Roose,

     The Computer Science Majors Committee wishes to propose a 
modification to the current policy allowing Computer Science 
students off-hours access to the computer lab located in the King 
building.

     Currently, students who are enrolled in a Computer Science 
course level 160 or higher are permitted to use the terminals in 
the King lab.  These students have the option of obtaining a pass 
to the King building that allows them access when the building is 
closed.  To gain access, a student must call the Security 
department, and present the pass to the officer responding, who 
opens the door for the student.  Typically, this process takes 
about twenty minutes, and interrupts the routine of the Security 
officer as well as the student.  However, since the only reason 
for using the King lab instead of other more accessible terminals 
has been the access to the King lab printer, this has not posed 
an insurmountable inconvenience.

     Recently, conditions have changed.  There is now greater 
demand for access to King lab during off-hours.  The Computer 
Science department has installed five Sun computer workstations 
in the lab.  These workstations constitute a new system housed 
entirely within the King building.  During the spring semester a 
new course, Computer Graphics, is being offered which will 
require the use of these machines.  Demand for these machines 
will be high, and intensive off-hour usage is anticipated.  

     The Computer Science Majors Committee has discussed the 
problem of increased King lab usage and we recommend that five 
keys with access to the outer doors of the King building be 
provided to the Computer Science department.  These will be 
available to students with accounts on the Sun stations from the 
Mathematics department secretary, who now handles distribution of 
building passes.  There will be a fifteen dollar fine payable by 
the student responsible in case of loss.  The keys will be 
checked out by eligible students for a period of one night or one 
weekend, and returned the next business day.   Students who do 
not check out keys will still have access under the old pass 
system.

     Each semester, lists will be kept of students who are 
eligible to check out keys to the building.  Students who have a 
need for frequent off-hours access will be included on these 
lists.  Before permission is granted for key access to the 
building, the student will sign an agreement signifying awareness 
of the privileged nature of this access, agreeing to responsible 
conduct, and to maintaining the building security and 
cleanliness.  

     Should the College adopt this proposal, the inconvenience 
for both Security and the Computer Science students will be 
greatly reduced.  Similar systems have been adopted by the 
College with regards to the Physics and Chemistry departments, 
with notable success.  In addition, the current pass system has 
been effective for several years despite its inconvenience, and 
merits expansion in view of the increased demand for the King 
lab.   The Computer Science Majors Committee urges the College to 
consider these factors in the decision to adopt this proposal.




                                      Sincerely,
        
        
        
                                      David C. Hersey
                                      Representative,
                                      Computer Science Majors Committee
