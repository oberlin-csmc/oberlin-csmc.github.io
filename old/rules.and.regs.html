SYSTEM RULES DOCUMENT
</H1>
<H2>
Version 0.1
</H2>

<H3>Note: We would like to make it clear that this document is just a
rough draft and does not represent the actual system rules.  The <A
HREF="interim.rules.html">interim</A> rules and regs document,
however, has been approved, and rules on it should be obeyed. If you
have any problems with those rules, PLEASE <A
HREF="inputform.html">tell</A> us or the committee working on the
final rules document (jbayes, jrochkin, rhys, and rich
@cs.oberlin.edu)
</H3>

<hr>
All System rules and regulations are on this document. 
Anything not specifically forbidden on this document is
permitted. Additions to this document may be made by contacting the
authors. Except where specifically listed, there is no penalty for
violating the given rule. Anyone has the right to publicly disagree,
verbally and in writing, with any rule on this list, without
penalty. When enforcing these rules, the system administrator should
take into account any extenuating circumstances (and the user has the
right to present any extenuating circumstances to the system
administrator). However, these rules should not be "selectively
enforced".  <P>

[Chuck proposed that we change "system administrator" above to read
"Director of Computer Science."] <P>

<UL>

<LI> 
If you leave the room for anywhere from 0 min to 15 minutes, use the
	xlock program to lock your console. If you leave the room for
	more than 15 minutes, LOG OUT. NEVER leave your X server
	unattended without xlock; i.e. DO NOT USE stuff like xmessage. 

<LI> 
You may not xlock your terminal for more than 30 minutes unless you
	use the -nolock option. If you leave your terminal unattended
	for more than 30 minutes, you may be logged out. 

<LI> 
NO DRINK IN THE LAB, period. I mean it. Bringing a drink into the lab
	is grounds for loss of account. Any food must be kept away
	from the keyboards and you must CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF if
	there are any crumbs, wrappers, or other messiness.  I would
	actually prefer to say NO FOOD as well, but I think I am just
	going to suggest that you use the lounge area until I need to
	say otherwise.

<LI> 
Keep the lab clean and organized.  Throw out scratch paper, candy
	wrappers, etc., put away your books, before you leave! 

<LI> 
Be considerate of others.  If music is to be played, get permission
	from everyone, negotiate a volume level, and if someone comes
	in and complains, negotiate with them.  

<LI> 
Refrain from any offensive behaviour that might interfere with other's
	work.

<LI> 
DO NOT block the air vents on the computers; they will overheat and fail.
	This lab is a advanced lab.  There are some freedoms granted
	in terms of windows, and doors.  The door may be propped open
	if it gets too hot, but please, if you are the last to leave,
	pull the door shut, and close AND LOCK the windows.  Also
	politely ask someone that obviously shouldn't be in there to
	move on.  

<LI> 
You may NOT turn off any CS equipment except in the case of a dire
	emergency. Contact an upper-level student if you need help
	unfreezing a machine.

<LI> 
If someone is playing a game, and someone else needs the machine for
	work, then the first person must stop playing the
	game. Not doing so when asked is grounds for loss of account. 
	Games not involving a computer are NOT TO BE PLAYED IN THE
	LAB; use the lounge area.  

<LI> 
Magic cards and other paraphenalia unrelated to CS (foam weapons, ...)
	should be stored NEATLY in the space above the closet.  All
	such stuff should NOT be strewn all over the place.  If this
	happens again this year, I am going to (and I fully intend to
	do this) throw stuff out on a daily basis in a random garbage
	can in the King/Rice compleand I will refuse to say where.

<LI> 
If you are logged on from a DECstation, you should run ALL non
	mega-CPU or I/O intensive stuff on the local machine.

<LI> 
No X games on occs. Chronic offenders will lose their accounts. 

<LI> 
Long running jobs should be niced to 19, and chuck should be informed
	about them. If the user is logged on, they should be contacted
	prior to the system manager's killing the job.

<LI> 
You may not let anyone else use your account, unless you are directly
	supervising them. Doing so is grounds for loss of account. 

<LI> 
You may not use the system as a launching platform in order to break
	into any other system, or perform any illegal activity. Doing
	so will be grounds for loss of account, and may invite further
	legal action.

<LI> 
You may not use the system to break any college rules or violate the
	honor code. Doing so is grounds for being reported to the
	Honor Committee.

<LI> 
Anything that is a network service, related to system security, or in
	general involves non-CS materials, hosts or whatever should be
	cleared by chuck BEFORE you start them. Not doing so is
	grounds for account suspension and disciplinary action
	referred to the Director of Computer Science. 

<LI> 
You may not use occs as a stepping stone to other places in order to
	get around site restrictions at one end. 

<LI> 
You may not run processes on faculty machines without the express
	permission of the faculty member in question.

<LI> 
You may not create a world-writable directory. Doing so may result in
	loss of account.

<LI> 
Passwords should contain no proper names, at least one number, letter,
	and punctuation symbol. The more esoteric the better.

<LI> 
occs can get bogged down at times, especially since it is the main
	fileserver. Please use csxt instead whenever possible.

<LI> 
Heavy i/o jobs should be run on occs. 

<LI> 
Don't hog system resources unnecessarily. 

<LI> 
Please limit xterms to 200 lines or so of scrollback.

<LI> 
Please limit xbiff -updates to 30 or 60

<LI> 
If something strange happens on any CS equipment, SEND CHUCK MAIL
	describing what happened in the most gory complete detail
	you absolutely can so that he can take action.  If you don't
	tell me, I can't solve the problem or even begin to look into
	it. Otherwise, I can do nothing and am inclined to delay as
	long as possible before rebooting it to make it as painful as
	I can for those who don't help me take corrective action. 

<LI> 
Please notify chuck if you no longer need your account. 

<LI> 
Please do not run nethack on occs over a telnet or dialup
	connection. If you are running nethack, and are disconnected
	unexpectedly and find that you cannot kill your process, send
	mail to public or chuck.  

<LI> 
Filenames should be of reasonable typing length containing
	a reasonable mix of characters.  Some systems that have access
	to occs' filesystems (and occs if the file is created via
	another non-unix system) have trouble with certain characters
	and file name lengths.

<LI> 
Also, for reasons related to system integrity, directory trees
	should not be nested excessively.  While this is not likely
	to happen in practice, there has been at least one instance
	of a highly nested frivolous directory tree construction
	causing the automatic reboot process to be aborted requiring
	manual intervention and adversely affecting the system's
	return to working status.

<LI> 
ONCE PER YEAR a request can be made to change one's userid.
	If approved by the Director of Computer Science, such a change
	will be done with appropriate handshaking and mail forwarding
	by the system manager.
