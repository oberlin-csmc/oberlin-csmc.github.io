<hr>
The csmc is in the process of drafting an online rules document
which contains the system rules that have been set down by the
Director of Computer Science and the
system administrator over the years.  We feel that having an online
document that contains all of the rules would help educate new 
system users and reduce confusion and conflict on the system.

There are currently three versions of this document:
<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="rules.and.regs.html">a rough draft (1994)</A>
<LI> <A HREF="interim.rules.html"> Currently IN EFFECT interim Rules
	&amp; Regs Document</A> This is basically the rough draft
	with some <A HREF="rules.and.regs.changes.html">changes</A>
	and rewordings all made by bob. (1995)
<LI> The third version doesn't exist yet. It will be the "final"
version of the document. A committee consisting of 
<A HREF="../jbayes/home.html">Joe Bayes</A> (jbayes@cs.oberlin.edu),  
<A HREF="http://www.oberlin.edu/~brchkind/">Jonathan Rochkind</A>
(jrochkin@cs.oberlin.edu), Rhys Price Jones (rhys@cs.oberlin.edu), and
Rich Salter (rms@cs.oberlin.edu) is working on it. Send mail to any of
them with suggestions or comments. 
</UL>

You can also send csmc your comments, either by sending csmc 
<A HREF="mailto:csmc@cs.oberlin.edu">email</A>
or by appending to our <A HREF="inputform.html">comment form</A>. <P>

Are there any rules that we have forgotten?
Is there anything unclear, contradictory, or just plain wrong? <P>

<H3>The interim Rules Document is currently in effect, rules on it
should be obeyed. If you have any problems with those rules PLEASE
tell us so that we can make the final rules document as good as
possible.
