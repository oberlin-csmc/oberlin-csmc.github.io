Abstract
</H2>

The free flow and exchange of information with a minimum of
impediment should be our highest goal, not only as members of a
college community but also as experts in information technology.
However, practical security issues must be considered when
managing a large, multi-user, network-accessible system. These
guidelines attempt to strike an intelligent balance between the
ideals of the freedom of information and the practicalities of
managing a large computer system. <P>
 
 
<H3>
First and foremost, everyone is encouraged to invent intelligent
passwords, e.g.
</H3>
 
<UL>
<LI> 
do not use common dictionary words
<LI> 
concatenate more than one word
<LI> 
use weird capitalization
<LI> 
use nonwords or nonsense
<LI> 
use numbers or other non-alpha characters
</UL>
 
 
<H3>
Guidelines for Users (e.g. persons with regular accounts)
</H3>
 
<UL>
<LI> 
possession of a "cracker" program is not in itself a problem.
Because: it is difficult to draw the line between "security risk"
and "non-risk" programs; it is possible that someone might be
studying the program for their own knowledge, etc.; general
principles of freedom of information. <P>
 
<LI> 
possession of a flat text file (unencrypted) of usernames and
passwords is a problem; there is too much of a risk that the file
could be discovered and used by someone other than the owner. <P>
 
<LI> 
An attempt to crack passwords or otherwise test system security
should either be with the knowledge & consent of the person who
owns the account (information) you are cracking, or with the
knowledge & consent of appropriate system types (e.g. Bob or
Chuck). Possible scenarios: <P>
 
 Two friends like to play a game to see if one of them can hack
into the other's account. In this case there is full knowledge on
both their parts about the actions of the other, and they have
agreed beforehand that it is an okay thing to do. <P>
 
 A student wants to run a new program he found on the net which
tests system security. After discussing it with Chuck or Bob,
showing them the program and telling them when he plans to run
it, they tell him to go ahead. He does, and lets them know the
results when the program finishes running. <P>
</UL>
 
 
In General: Because it's a sizeable system, it's hard to keep
track of everything that's happening on it. Anything that looks
suspicious or might be construed as someone attempting to crack
system security is a pain in the ass for the system manager
types, so just TELL them before you do anything along those
lines, and they'll be cool about it, and there'll be no problem. <P>
 
 
 
<H3>
Superusers (e.g. persons with root access or who can otherwise
bypass the regular file protection scheme)
</H3>

<UL>
<LI> 
A superuser should not look at a user's directories/files that
are not normally world-readable unless s/he has a valid reason
for doing so in the context of system administration. <P>
 
<LI> 
If a superuser looks at a user's directories/files that are not
normally world readable, s/he should inform that user. Though it
would be preferable to inform the user before looking, obviously
there are cases in which the superuser feels s/he cannot wait
(e.g. investigation into possible violations of system security);
in these cases, the person whose account is being perused should
be informed within a reasonable time period (e.g. within 48
hours, hopefully less time). <P>
 
<LI> 
If any kind of system security check is done (e.g. a password
"cracker" run) the results of this check must be publicly posted
(e.g. to msgs) within reasonable time after it is done, and
anyone who is identified by this security check as an unwitting
security risk (e.g. has an easy-to-crack password) must be
informed specifically (e.g. in person or via e-mail). <P>
</UL>
 
In General: As a superuser, you have extra responsibility; for
example, it is your responsibility to identify possible security
problems and correct them. You also have extra power, which
should be used intelligently; beyond simply not looking at files
you shouldn't, you must also inform the users of your actions
when appropriate, and make people aware of what you can and
cannot do. People will trust and respect you more if you inform
them about what you are doing, and are capable of doing; hiding
behind a shield of authority and/or superior technical knowledge
is nonproductive and unnecessary. <P>
