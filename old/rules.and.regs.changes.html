Differences between the <A HREF="rules.and.regs.html"> rough draft</A> and 
the <A HREF="interim.rules.html">current (interim) document</A>:
</H1>

<H3>The <A HREF="interim.rules.html">interim</A> rules and regs
document, however, has been approved, and rules on it should be
obeyed. If you have any problems with those rules, PLEASE <A
HREF="inputform.html">tell</A> us or the committee working on the
final rules document (jbayes, jrochkin, rhys, and rich
@cs.oberlin.edu) </H3>
<hr>
This document talks about textual (and some opinion) differences
between the csmc's original document and the current interim document.


<UL>

<LI> Intro: should we get bob to include this (it was taken out of the
	intro): Anyone has the right to publicly disagree, verbally
	and in writing,	with any rule on this list, without penalty.


<LI>  rule 1: bob added the following:
	You are responsible for anything that happens through your 
	account.


<LI>  bob removed:  
	You may not xlock your terminal for more than 30 minutes
	unless you use the -nolock option. If you leave your terminal
	unattended for more than 30 minutes, you may be logged out. 


<LI>  rule 6: bob removed:
	Also politely ask someone that obviously shouldn't be in there
	to move on.  


<LI>  rule 7: and reworded it as follows:
	Only CS students and those specifically authorized are allowed
	to use the lab.  If you see people in the lab who shouldn't be
	there, politely ask them to move on. 

<UL>
<LI> what is a CS student
<LI> what's "specifically authorized" mean?
<LI> clarify "shouldn't be there" -- maybe it should be reworded
	   as "don't fit into the categories mentioned above"
</UL>
	
<LI>  rule 8: "unfreezing" should be clarified as "you need help fixing a
	machine" or something non labbies would definitely understand.


<LI>  rule 9: add a sentence: "in general, the machines are here
	primarily for educational purposes, and people who need the
	machine for such purposes have the highest priority"


<LI>  rule 12: Bob removed:
	"If the user is logged on, they should be contacted prior to
	 the system manager's killing the job."


<LI>  bob removed the following rule: 
	You may not use the system to break any college rules or violate the
	honor code. Doing so is grounds for being reported to the
	Honor Committee.

<LI>  bob removed:
	No games or non-cs related material in /usr/users/students. 

<LI>  rule 16: can we get rid of this? 
	is there anyone left who has a machine that students can
	run processes on who doesn't want students to do so?

<LI>  rule 17: why does this rule exist? 
	You may not create a world-writable directory. 
 

<LI> rule 27: why is this rule even here? 
	Filenames should be of reasonable typing length containing a
	reasonable mix of characters.  Some systems that have access 
	to occs' filesystems (and occs if the file is created via
	another non-unix system) have trouble with certain characters
	and file name lengths.


<LI> bob removed:
	This document was assembled by the Fall '94 CSMC, largely from
	msgs posts by ctilburg. Questions, comments, and maintenence
	requests to jbayes (or csmc).
