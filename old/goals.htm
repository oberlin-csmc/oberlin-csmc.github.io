We love each and every one of you little CS monkeys, and we want to do anything in our power to make you love us.  Moreover, we want generations of Oberlin Computer Science students to love us, as we are dedicated to making the Oberlin College Computer Science Department the best darn CS department ever.  Each member of CSMC has a unique power that we bring together to form Captain Computer Science, capable of making T-shirts, hosting Unix/Emacs night, and discussing the department ad naseum.  Just because we love you that much.
