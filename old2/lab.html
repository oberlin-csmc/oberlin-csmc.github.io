<center><h3>Lab Rules and Regulations</h3></center>
<ul>
<li>When rebooting a machine, use the proper procedure and do not hard
reboot (i.e. don't just press the reset button). </li>

<li>Do not install licensed software onto any of the Computer Science
machines without prior approval of the systems administrator. To do so
otherwise is strictly forbidden. </li>

<li>You are responsible for anything that happens through your
account. Never leave an X server unattended. If you must leave the lab
briefly, use the xlock program to lock your console. If you leave the
lab for more than 15 minutes, LOG OUT. NEVER leave your X server
unattended without xlock; i.e. DO NOT USE stuff like xmessage. </li>

<li>Be aware that accidental spills of drinks and beverages could destroy
a machine. Any food must be kept away from the keyboards and you must
clean up after yourself. The lounge area is a much better place to eat
than the lab. </li>

<li>Keep the lab clean and organized. Throw out scratch paper, candy
wrappers, etc., put away your books, before you leave! 
Be considerate of others. This is a work area. Do not play music if
anyone objects to it. </li>

<li>Refrain from any offensive behavior that might interfere with other's
work. This includes downloading and/or viewing pornography. 
Only CS students and those specifically authorized are allowed to use
the lab. If you see people in the lab who shouldn't be there, politely
ask them to move on. </li>

<li>Do not turn off any CS equipment except in the case of a dire
emergency. Contact an upper-level student if you need help unfreezing
a machine. </li>

<li>Game playing has the lowest priority for machine usage. If you are
playing a game and someone else needs your station for work, you must
yield to them. Games not involving computers should not be played in
the lab. </li>
<p>

 
<li>Long-running jobs should be niced to 19, and the system manager should
be informed of them. </li>
<li>You may not let anyone else use your account, unless you are directly
supervising them. </li>

<li>You may not use the system as a launching platform in order to break
into any other system, to steal software, or to perform any illegal
activity. </li>

<li>Any network service, and anything that might compromise system
security. must be cleared by the system manager before being started. </li>

<li>You may not run processes on faculty machines without the express
permission of the faculty member in question. </li>

<li>You may not create a world-writable directory. 
Passwords should contain no proper names, at least one number, letter,
and punctuation symbol. The more esoteric the better. </li>

<li>Do not hog system resources unnecessarily. </li>

<li>If something strange happens on any CS equipment, send mail to the
system manager describing what happened in complete detail so that he
can take action. </li>

<li>Please notify the system manager if you no longer need your account.</li>

<li>Directory trees should not be nested excessively. While this is not
likely to happen in practice, there has been at least one instance of
a highly nested frivolous directory tree construction causing the
automatic reboot process to be aborted requiring manual intervention
and adversely affecting the system's return to working status. </li>
</ul>
