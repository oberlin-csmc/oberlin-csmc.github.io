<center><u>Oberlin College Computer Science <br>Majors' Committee Charter</u>
</center></font>
<p>
<p> 
<p> 
<font size=4><u><b>Purpose & Responsibilities</b></u></font>
<p> 

The Computer Science Majors' Committee (CSMC) exists to serve as a
representative body for Computer Science (CS) students.  The Committee
shall, as necessary, set and enforce policy for the CS labs (games,
noise food, et cetera), and will work to bolster the Oberlin Computer
Science Community through activities, T-shirts, and special events
(UNIX/Emacs night, Games Night, Hat Day, CS tea, etc.).
<p> 

<font size=4><u><b>Membership</b></u></font><br><p>
Members of the Committee are elected for a full or partial school
year.  All members' terms end at the close of the Spring Semester.
Members must be declared CS majors.  Members must attend all CSMC
meetings except in special circumstances. A member who is absent from
three meetings becomes "inactive" and may be removed from the CSMC by
unanimous agreement among all active members. In addition, members are
expected to participate in the activities of the CSMC.
<p> 

<font size=4><u><b>Committee Anatomy</b></u></font><br><p>
The Committee shall be made up of six CS majors, at least three of
which should not be graduating at the end of their term.  The
Committee is responsible for selecting its own officers after
elections, either at the end of the outgoing term or at the beginning
of the new term.  The Committee must elect at least Chair and Co-chair
positions; the Committee may create and elect additional secondary
positions for the duration of its term as necessary.
<p> 

<font size=4><u><b>Meetings</b></u></font><br><p>
The Committee shall hold meetings weekly that will generally be open
to all students who wish to attend.  The Committee shall publish
important notes from meetings as necessary.
<p> 

<font size=4><u><b>Elections</b></u></font><br><p>
The Committee shall hold an election on the second week of April of
its term to elect the Committee for the following year; the election
may be held another week if special circumstances would depress
attendance or turnout of CS students.  The Committee shall publicize
the election to CS majors in the weeks prior to the election.  The
date, time, and location of the election meeting shall be sent in
advance to all majors and posted on msgs. The Committee chair or
co-chair shall preside over the election; should neither the chair nor
the co-chair be present, the most senior Committee member present
shall preside over the election. The election shall be divided into
three parts: nominations, candidate statements, and voting.
<p>

<ul>
<li><u><b>Nominations</b></u><br><p>
Majors may nominate themselves or be nominated by others as candidates
for election.  Majors who are nominated must be present to accept or
decline except in special circumstances.  If only six candidates
accept nominations, candidates may be accepted as a single slate so
long as there are no objections.</li>

<li><u><b>Candidate Statements</b></u><br><p>
Subsequent to nominations, all candidates shall have time to make a
brief personal statement regarding themselves and their candidacy to
those present.  Once all candidates have made statements, students
present may engage in a brief question and answer session with the
candidates as directed by the Committee member running the election.

<li><u><b>Voting</b></u><br><p>
Once candidate statements and questions have been completed, voting
will proceed in two rounds.  In the first round, up to three positions
for members who will not be graduating at the end of the new Committee
term will be elected first; if there are fewer than three such
candidates, that number of such positions will be voted on first.
Once these positions are filled, all unelected candidates run for the
remaining positions.  In either round, if there are fewer candidates
than positions, those candidates may be accepted as a single slate so
long as there are no objections.  Each person voting may vote for as
many candidates as there are positions in a given round, but may not
vote for a candidate more than once.  Voting shall be done by secret
ballot.  Candidates in each round shall vote first, and then shall
step out from the meeting so the remaining majors can enter closed
discussion.  During closed discussion, majors shall have the
opportunity to discuss the candidates in that round privately and at
length and then vote by secret ballot.  Candidates in a round may not
count the ballots from their round.  Once the incoming Committee has
been elected, the new Committee membership shall be posted to msgs.

<li><u><b>Resignations and Special Elections</b></u><br><p>
If a member chooses to resign, he or she will provide one week's
previous notice at a Committee meeting.  He or she will be required to
continue to perform any requisite duties until the next Committee
meeting.  The Committee shall then call a special election in a prompt
manner to fill the position according with the previously detailed
election standards.
</ul>
<p>
<font size=4><u><b>Amendments to this document</b></u></font><br><p>
Any proposed amendment to this charter must be announced six days
before it is to be voted upon. An amendment will be accepted if it is
approved by two-thirds of the CS students voting on it.
