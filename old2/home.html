Our goal, pure and simple? To make you happy, baby. Department got you
down? Need someone to regulate? That's us. Want someone to explain
what that crazy emacs thing is? Us again. Unexplained rash? Talk to us
about it. Need help? <b>Email us (csmc [at] cs.oberlin.edu)</b>. We love each
and every one of you little CS monkeys, and we want to do anything in
our power to make you love us. Moreover, we want generations of
Oberlin Computer Science students to love us, as we are dedicated to
making the Oberlin College Computer Science Department the best darn
CS department ever. Each member of CSMC has a unique power that we
bring together to form Captain Computer Science, capable of making
T-shirts, hosting Unix/Emacs night, and discussing the department ad
nauseum. Just because we love you that much.
