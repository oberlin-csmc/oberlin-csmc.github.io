			<ul><li> Please be careful with food and drink. <BR>
			If possible, use closed/closable containers.<BR>
			<BR>
			If you do spill, clean it up immediately <BR>
			and if it damages equipment,<BR>
			please do what you can to help replace it.<BR>
			<BR>
			The lounge outside the lab is a better place to eat.<BR>
			<BR>
			</li><li> Before you leave the lab,<BR>
			make sure you have thrown away any trash<BR>
			you may have created<BR>
			and put away any books you've taken out. <BR>
			<BR>
			</li><li> If you are the last person to leave the lab, <BR>
			please make sure the lights are off, <BR>
			the windows are closed and latched, <BR>
			and the door is closed.<BR>
			<BR>
			</li><li> Computer Science students are the only students<BR>

			<BR>
			In the unlikely case that you have no option<BR>
			but to kill someone's session,<BR>
			check first to see if they are running any processes<BR>
			(ps aux | grep <I>username</I>)<BR>
			so you do not interrupt something important.</li></ul></FONT>
