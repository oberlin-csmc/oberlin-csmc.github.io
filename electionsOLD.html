<h1>A Message To All</h1>
<p>Dear CS majors,</p>
<p>We are holding elections for this spring and the coming year. It is an exciting time to get involved, since with the 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary of OCCS, much input from the
students is wanted and needed. As one example, the CS department has the lovely display case in the Science Center atrium, and <strong>your input</strong>
can help shape what goes in there!</p>
<p><strong>You may nominate yourself, or any CS major, until next Wednesday, Feb. 17<sup>th</sup>.</strong> At that time, we will hold traditional elections in the <strong>downstairs lab</strong>.
Six members will be elected, no more than three graduating, and all seats are open.</p>
<p><strong>If you are nominated,</strong> we will send you an email giving you some directions for composing a short candidate statement. All nominated <u>CS majors</u> are eligible; this means that
if you were nominated, and you intend to major in CS, and you are very interested but not officially declared, you must begin the declaration process before being elected.</p>
<p><strong>Voting will be in the downstairs lab next Wednesday, Feb 17<sup>th</sup></strong>. All majors and current CS students are urged to attend! This session will include (1)
a short oral statement given by each candidate, and (2) a vote.</p>
<p>For now, please consider nominating yourself or someone you know who may be interested. If you have questions, do not hesitate to ask us: Michael Brooks, Nathaniel Gephart, and Katie Kuksenok. CSMC also
has an official email, <strong>csmc at cs dot oberlin dot edu</strong>.</p>
