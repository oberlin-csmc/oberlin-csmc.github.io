<h1>Git Night!
</br>
Thursday, October 10th, 8:30pm </h1>

<p>
Have you ever had more than one copy of a file just to make sure you wouldn't lose good code? Want to work with other people without ever emailing files/Google docs/flash key/etc? Want a system to automatically track all the things you do and integrate changes other people make into one file? Come to Git night, where you'll learn to do all the above (and more) and become a Kit-Kat certified octo-wizard.
